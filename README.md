# NewsMapTracker

This project is a news dashboard that displays up-to-date news in real time on a world map based 
on location of occurrence. Every hour, a new set of markers are displayed on the map, each pinpointing the location of a recent news event. Upon clicking a marker,
you will see the headline for that event as well as a link to the news article.
