(AP) — Florida prosecutors seeking the death penalty for a plastic surgeon accused of killing a lawyer and dumping his body in the Everglades have laid out their case in new court filings. Authorities say Dr. Tomasz Kosowski killed attorney Steven Cozzi in the bathroom of Cozzi’s law office moments after both participated in a March 21 conference call about a lengthy, acrimonious legal battle over medical billing. Prosecutors said in court documents that Kosowski took the call from a Toyota pickup truck outside the office and that he had supplies to commit the killing, including trash bags, a syringe containing a paralyzing drug and a wagon to haul the corpse out. Although Cozzi’s body has never been found, investigators used cellphone records and surveillance video to track Kosowski to a remote area west of Miami on the Tamiami Trail, also known as U.S. Highway 41. That’s where they believe Kosowski tossed the body into a Dumpster that was eventually emptied by a garbage truck. The driver noticed an unusually “vile” smell at the stop, authorities said. “Video from the garbage truck of the Dumpster being emptied into the garbage truck shows a large garbage bag falling in a manner inconsistent with normal trash,” prosecutors said in a motion asking a judge to hold Kosowski without bond. The parcel’s shape and the way it fell looked consistent with something that might hold a human body, they said. A police cadaver dog also indicated a body had been in the Dumpster, according to court documents filed Friday. Trash from the route is typically hauled to a Collier County landfill, but authorities who searched the property for Cozzi’s body said the facility routinely compacts its trash, “making recovery efforts nearly impossible.” The new details emerged in court filings ahead of a July 17 hearing in which Kosowski’s lawyers plan to seek his release on bail. In Florida, anyone accused of first-degree murder is generally jailed until trial unless the defense can show a compelling reason they shouldn’t be. Kosowski, 44, has pleaded not guilty. A graduate of Dartmouth College medical school, he has specialized in reconstructive breast surgery for eight years, according to papers filed by his lawyers. They contend the prosecution’s case is flimsy, that Kosowski poses no threat and that their client will not try to evade justice. If released, Kosowski plans to stay at his multimillion-dollar waterfront home in Tarpon Springs. The new court documents detail prosecutors’ evidence against Kosowski, including Cozzi’s blood and DNA found in the law office bathroom and in the garage at Kosowski’s home, where it was mixed with the doctor’s DNA. In addition, authorities say Kosowski bought the Toyota truck with cash weeks before Cozzi’s slaying and never registered the vehicle, which had a license plate flipping device that allowed tags to be substituted with the touch of a button. One of the license plates associated with it was registered to a dead person. When Kosowski was arrested March 25, investigators said he had $280,000 in cash, masks, duct tape, firearms, a ballistic vest with “EMS” written on it, law enforcement patches and a vial of succinylcholine, which is a paralyzing drug. A search of his home turned up about 200 guns, according to court documents. Cozzi, meanwhile, seemingly disappeared without a trace. His keys, wallet and cellphone remained on his law office desk and a work file was open on his computer. His husband has not heard from him. The missing lawyer represented a Dunedin, Florida-based medical practice that Kosowski alleged shorted him thousands of dollars in billings and damaged his reputation as a doctor. The dispute got so heated that Kosowski tried to get Cozzi removed from the case and at one point allegedly called Cozzi a “scumbag” during an encounter in the same law office bathroom where prosecutors say the attorney was slain.

To continue reading, please subscribe: + GST for 9 weeks of unlimited access* BINDURA, Zimbabwe (AP) — Opposition party supporters in Zimbabwe chanted and sang freedom songs outside a courthouse Sunday following a decision to ban them from holding a rally six weeks before elections. The court in the town of Bindura upheld Friday’s police order that the opposition Citizens Coalition for Change party could not hold the rally to officially launch its election campaign because the venue was unsuitable. The CCC had appealed in court against the order. The decision increased tensions in the southern African nation, which has a history of violent and disputed elections. The CCC immediately criticized the move as more evidence of a push by President Emmerson Mnangagwa and his ruling ZANU-PF party to silence the opposition using the police and the courts. Mnangagwa, 80, replaced long-ruling autocrat Robert Mugabe in a coup in 2017. He promised a new era of freedom and prosperity for Zimbabweans, who had seen their country’s economy crumble amid some of the highest inflation rates ever seen. But Mnangagwa has turned out to be as repressive as his predecessor, say critics, and the economy continues to collapse. There has been a crackdown on any kind of criticism. The yellow-clad CCC supporters who gathered outside Bindura Magistrates Court sang “Dictatorship remains. When will this country be free?” Police said that the opposition party’s chosen venue for Sunday’s rally was unsuitable because it was a “bushy” area with poor access via road, raising safety concerns for those attending. The police also said there was a “high risk” of the spread of communicable diseases. A rally where thousands of ruling party supporters packed tightly together in a stadium to hear Mnangagwa speak was allowed to go ahead on Saturday. “We are getting into a match with both legs tied,” said CCC lawyer Agency Gumbo. “They would rather keep the opposition at the courts than on the campaign trail.” There was “an uneven playing ground that shows that the democratic process has been corroded,” Gumbo said. The CCC initially appealed against the police order at the High Court in the capital, Harare on Saturday. The case was moved to the court in Bindura, where the rally was scheduled to take place. The Bindura court eventually ruled late afternoon on Sunday, hours after the rally was meant to start at 10 a.m. The CCC says the repression in the buildup to the Aug. 23 elections has included violence and intimidation against its supporters, the arrest of its officials and bans on its meetings. The opposition has also raised concerns over alleged voters’ roll irregularities ahead of elections that will decide the presidency but also the makeup of the Parliament and nearly 2,000 local government positions. Mnangagwa and his administration have denied the allegations of intimidation, with the president recently describing Zimbabwe as “a mature democracy.” CCC leader Nelson Chamisa lost narrowly to Mnangwagwa in the 2018 presidential election and had his claim of vote-rigging rejected by the Constitutional Court. Mnangagwa and the 45-year-old Chamisa are two of 11 candidates who have registered to stand in next month’s presidential election. ___ More AP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa Advertisement","pubDate":"2023-07-09 18:01:54","image_url":null,"source_id":"winnipegfreepress","category":["world"],"country":["canada"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Authorities identify 6 people killed in plane crash in southern California","link":"https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/world/2023/07/09/authorities-identify-6-people-killed-in-plane-crash-in-southern-california","keywords":["World"],"creator":["Feedloaderapi"],"video_url":null,"description":"MURRIETA, Calif.

(AP) — Authorities have identified the six California residents who died Saturday when they were on a small plane that crashed after a flight that started in Las Vegas. A spokesperson for the Federal Aviation Administration, Mina Kaji, told The Press-Enterprise in Riverside, California, that the Cessna C550 business jet took off from Harry Reid International Airport at about 3:15 a.m. Saturday. The plane crashed about an hour later at French Valley Airport in Murrieta, California, about 80 miles (130 kilometers) southeast of Los Angeles. All aboard were killed. Riverside County Sheriff-Coroner Chad Bianco identified those who died as Lindsey Gleiche, 31, of Huntington Beach; Riese Lenders, 25, of Rancho Palos Verdes; Alma Razick, 51, of Temecula; Ibrahem Razick, 46, of Temecula; Abigail Tellez-Vargas, 33, of Murrieta; and Manuel Vargas-Regalado, 32, of Temecula. Bianco did not release other details. The crash occurred during the second of two landing attempts in fog just before dawn, authorities said. The jet, which can seat up to 13 people, crashed about 500 feet (150 meters) short of the intended runway, said Elliott Simpson, an investigator with the National Transportation Safety Board. Simpson said fire consumed most of the plane.

Democrats and Republicans were split, with members of both parties siding with and against Biden’s decision. Those against mainly cited the threat the weapons pose on civilian’s safety. The Biden administration last week that it planned to provide Ukraine with cluster munitions, which contain multiple explosive submunitions and are by many countries due to the risks. Biden has his decision, saying in an interview with CNN that he believes Ukraine “needed them.” He also said that it was a “very difficult decision” made after discussing it with allies and lawmakers. Democrats on Sunday shows appeared be torn on whether to support the cluster bombs. California Rep. Barbara Lee (D) at Biden’s approval of cluster munitions to Ukraine as the country prepares a counteroffensive against Russia’s invasion. “Cluster bombs should never be used. That’s crossing a line,” Lee said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “Once you see what takes place, we know what takes place in terms of cluster bombs being very dangerous to civilians. They don’t always immediately explode. Children can step on them. That’s a line we should not cross,” she added. Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) also about the cluster munitions on Sunday, saying that he has some “real qualms” about the decision. He pointed to a 2008 treaty signed by 123 countries that pledged not to use cluster munition weapons in war, but the U.S., Russia and Ukraine are not signatories on the treaty. He did offer some praise for the Biden administration’s agreement with Ukraine so it will use them “in a way to dislodge Russian military while minimizing risks to Ukrainian civilians.” “I would still say, though, I have some real qualms about it,” he told anchor Shannon Bream on “Fox News Sunday.” “When there’s an international prohibition, and the U.S. says, ‘But here’s a good reason to do something different,’ it could give a green light to other nations to do something different as well.” Democratic Sen. Chris Coons (Del.) said Sunday that he to send the weapons to Ukraine, adding that the country was burning through artillery munitions “at a remarkable rate.” He also said that the Ukrainians “are at risk of losing this counter offensive if they run out of their shells,” which is why he backed the decision. “It’s the Ukrainians who are asking to be able to use these on their own soil. They’ve committed to monitoring their use, to remediating them after the war. And frankly, they will be tactically helpful against dug-in Russian troops that are behind large mine fields. So, weighing all of those factors, the president made a tough call that I will support,” Coons said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul (R-Texas), meanwhile, said Sunday that he sees no wrong in sending cluster munitions to Ukraine, noting that they could actually be a in its efforts against the Russia invasion. McCaul has been a frequent critic of what he sees as the Biden administration moving to slow to provide Ukraine with military weaponry. “They want these as self-defense to use against Russians in their own country of Ukraine. I don’t see anything wrong with that because, quite honestly, … as you look at the counteroffensive, it’s been slowed tremendously because this administration has been so slow to get the weapons in,” McCaul said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”","pubDate":"2023-07-09 17:40:09","image_url":"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/07/cluster-munitions-2.png?w=900","source_id":"thehill","category":["world"],"country":["united states of america"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Italy agrees to lift ban on flights from conflict-stricken Libya, officials say","link":"https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/world/2023/07/09/italy-agrees-to-lift-ban-on-flights-from-conflict-stricken-libya-officials-say","keywords":["World"],"creator":["Feedloaderapi"],"video_url":null,"description":"CAIRO (AP) — Commercial flights between Italy and conflict-torn Libya will resume in September after the Italian government agreed to lift a 10-year-long ban on civil aviation in the North […]","content":"CAIRO (AP) — Commercial flights between Italy and conflict-torn Libya will resume in September after the Italian government agreed to lift a 10-year-long ban on civil aviation in the North African nation, one of Libya’s rival governments said Sunday.

Abdul-Hamid Dbeibah, prime minister of the Tripoli-based government, said on Twitter that the Italian government of Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni informed his government of the decision. He called the removal of the ban a “breakthrough.” The decision came after Libyan and Italian aviation officials met Sunday in the Libyan capital of Tripoli to discuss “the upcoming restoration of direct flights and the strengthening of cooperation” between the two countries, according to a statement from the Italian Embassy in Libya. Oil-rich Libya plunged into chaos after a NATO-backed uprising toppled and killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi in 2011. In the disarray that followed, the country split into rival administrations in the east and west, each backed by rogue militias and foreign governments. Italy and other European countries banned Libyan flights from their airspace as the country descended into chaos. Over the past decade, Libya has had direct flights to limited destinations, including cities in neighboring Egypt and Tunisia, and other Middle Eastern countries, such as Jordan. A Libyan government statement said the two countries have agreed that one airliner from each country would operate flights starting in September. They did not name the destination cities.

To continue reading, please subscribe: + GST for 9 weeks of unlimited access* WIMBLEDON, England (AP) — When 16-year-old Mirra Andreeva needed some advice after losing in the third round at her first major tennis tournament, she didn’t have go far. Sure, her parents and coaches have played huge roles in helping her become the latest teen sensation in tennis. But Andreeva knows herself better than anyone else does, so the conversation after this year’s French Open stayed internal. “Honestly, after Paris I just had quite a long talk with myself, just me and myself, and that’s it. I talked to myself. I just talked,” Andreeva said. “I don’t know, just in my head I realized some things. I took some decisions that I think are now important for me.” In her second major tournament, Andreeva has already done one better, advancing to the fourth round at Wimbledon following a 6-2, 7-5 victory over 22nd-seeded Anastasia Potapova on No. 3 Court. “I did a good job because now everything is working so far,” said the Russian teen who trains in France. “Yes, I just talked with myself, and I decided everything what I have to do next. So far it’s working.” Andreeva became the youngest player to reach the fourth round at Wimbledon since Coco Gauff in 2019. She will next face will No. 25 Madison Keys for a spot in the quarterfinals. Pretty heavy stuff for a teenager who is being touted as a potential superstar on the tennis circuit. “Actually, I think I’m just a normal teenager, like normal girl. I do, I think, everything that the girls my age do. I love to watch some series. I have to do my school. I have no choice. I have to suffer for two more years, and that’s it,” Andreeva said, smiling at that last part. “Sometimes it depends on my mood, but sometimes I prefer to be alone, just with myself, yes.” For such a young player, her maturity came through on court. After winning the first set on Sunday, she found herself trailing 4-1 in the second. Keeping her cool, she was able to regroup and take back control. “Today, honestly, even if I wanted to show some emotions, I honestly, I couldn’t because I was out of breath almost every point,” Andreeva said in an on-court interview. “I really couldn’t show any emotions.” Fridays The Free Press sports editor keeps you up to date on all that’s happening on the ice, the field, the court, and places in between. They came out after, though, when she sat in her chair and pulled her purple Wimbledon towel up over her face for a few seconds to regain her composure. The pressure at the oldest Grand Slam tournament will only intensify. After six straight victories in her only six times playing on grass — three in qualifying and three in the main draw — Andreeva is now looking to emulate 2021 U.S. Open champion Emma Raducanu and become only the second qualifier in history to win a major tournament. “Of course, in 2021 she did amazing job. Everyone was impressed,” Andreeva said of Raducanu, a British player who is missing Wimbledon this year because of injuries. “But me, I just try to not think about it. I think it will disturb me, all these thoughts. I just try to play every match and don’t think how far I have gone already or which round I’m playing, against who I’m playing.” ___ AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports Advertisement","pubDate":"2023-07-09 17:29:30","image_url":null,"source_id":"winnipegfreepress","category":["world"],"country":["canada"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Gunmen have killed 24 villagers in latest attack in Nigeria’s hard-hit north","link":"https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/world/2023/07/09/gunmen-have-killed-24-villagers-in-latest-attack-in-nigerias-hard-hit-north","keywords":["World"],"creator":["Feedloaderapi"],"video_url":null,"description":"ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — Gunmen killed 24 villagers in a remote part of north-central Nigeria, authorities said on Sunday, raising further concerns about the West African nation’s ongoing security challenges.

The gunmen arrived at the Akpuuna village in Benue state’s Ukum district on Saturday, shooting dead the villagers before escaping the area, according to Tersoo Kula, the spokesman for Benue state’s governor. Police blamed the attack on a “militia gang,” a common reference to armed groups in Nigeria’s hard-hit northwest and central regions where armed violence has claimed the lives of thousands in the last year. Catherine Anene, police spokeswoman in Benue, said eight bodies were retrieved from the scene. Local officials, including legislator Ezra Nyiyongo, said there were at least 24 killed and several others injured. “I lack words to express my shock and sympathy to the families of the lost ones,” said Nyiyongo as he published the names of those killed. Benue Gov. Hyacinth Iormem Alia said the attack was unprovoked and directed security agents to hunt for the suspects, his spokesman Kula said. “Government will do everything possible to put measures in place to checkmate these things and forestall a re-occurrence,” Kalu said. Such attacks are common in many parts of Nigeria’s northern region where local herdsmen have clashed in the past with farmers over limited access to land and water. More than 100 people have been killed this year in the violence in Benue alone. Arrests are rare after the killings. The gunmen in the latest incident operated for more than two hours without the intervention of security forces, according to Emmanuel Udende, who represents the village at the Nigerian Senate. His comment re-echoed concerns about the security of villagers in many violent hotspots where the Nigerian security forces are far outnumbered and outgunned.

Continuous enrollment rules ended on , and it hasn’t taken long for states to get to work disenrolling people. By mid-June, people had already lost Medicaid benefits, and the estimates that approximately 8 million to 24 million could be disenrolled within 12 months. Certain groups are more likely to lose coverage than others, according to KFF, as a result of barriers in the renewal process. These groups include people who have moved, immigrants and people with limited English proficiency, people with disabilities and older adults. Many, if not most, people who lose coverage in the renewal process won’t be covered any other way; they’ll simply be uninsured. People lose Medicaid for substantive eligibility reasons, such as getting a job with better wages and benefits. When that happens, those people no longer need the safety net. But most Medicaid enrollees don’t suddenly earn too much to qualify for public benefits. Rather, many lose Medicaid because of administrative reasons: They don’t return paperwork asking them to verify their income or their mail gets returned to sender and the Medicaid agency uses that as a flimsy pretext to disqualify them, presuming they’ve moved out of state and no longer qualify. While it’s important not to use precious public dollars for people who don’t need assistance, too often, Medicaid disenrollment hits hardest for people who most need help: those who are living in poverty, often in unstable housing and juggling the demands of caring for children and trying to earn a living wage. They are mothers and caregivers trying to get by. Among non-elderly enrollees who do not have a disability, work full- or part-time. Who among us hasn’t forgotten to fill out a form when we’re drowning in extraordinary or even routine hassles of life? But for women on Medicaid, failing to return a government form or forgetting to update the state agency with a new address can mean the difference between access to vital healthcare services and going without care, potentially letting small problems become big ones or missing serious diagnoses that need attention. Without insurance and no means to pay out of pocket, more women will simply skip needed care, including preventive tests such as mammograms, Pap tests and colonoscopies. Deferred care and screening will lead to more diagnoses that are more serious and harder and more expensive to treat. The impact goes beyond any individual woman. When moms and caregivers aren’t well and can’t take care of themselves, their families suffer. Women miss work or the chance to get meaningful employment. Not only do those women and their families risk falling deeper into poverty, their communities and the economy as a whole miss out on their productive contributions. It’s an economic drag for everyone when sizable portions of the population are held back by ill health and lack of access to preventive care. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services states to move slowly and spread out the renewal process over 12 months. They are encouraging states to conduct public awareness campaigns to educate residents about the process to avoid unnecessary disenrollments. And they’re recommending that state Medicaid agencies collaborate with private- and public-sector partners to reach the people who need to know that their health coverage is at risk so they can take actions to stay covered if they’re eligible. States should do all that . In particular, states should recognize Medicaid as more than a public expenditure. It is also an economic engine. A showed that expanding Medicaid would create billions in new state revenues and more than 1 million new jobs. And, Medicaid can be a force for improving equity in society by ensuring that women have the means to take care of themselves and their families. It is essential that states demonstrate that they care about women, their children and families by preserving Medicaid access for those who need it. The health of their economy depends on it. States must reduce administrative hassles and hurdles. They also should flip the script: Instead of looking for any excuse to cut people, states should seek opportunities to ensure continuous enrollment. It’s a good investment in keeping their states healthy, both physically and fiscally.","pubDate":"2023-07-09 17:00:00","image_url":"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/05/medicaid_work_requirement_04302023_AP_.jpg?w=900","source_id":"thehill","category":["politics"],"country":["united states of america"],"language":"english"},{"title":"New museum in Alabama tells history of last known slave ship to US and its survivors","link":"https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/world/2023/07/09/new-museum-in-alabama-tells-history-of-last-known-slave-ship-to-us-and-its-survivors","keywords":["World"],"creator":["Feedloaderapi"],"video_url":null,"description":"MOBILE, Ala.

(AP) — A museum that tells the history of the Clotilda — the last ship known to transport Africans to the American South for enslavement — opened Saturday, exactly 163 years after the vessel arrived in Alabama’s Mobile Bay. Ceremonies dedicating the $1.3 million Africatown Heritage House and “Clotilda: The Exhibition” took place Friday and Saturday in Mobile. The exhibit tells about the ship, its survivors and how they founded Africatown community in Mobile after they were freed from five years of slavery following the Civil War. The Clotilda departed Alabama in 1860, more than 50 years after Congress outlawed the importation of additional enslaved people, on a clandestine trip funded by Timothy Meaher, whose descendants still own millions of dollars worth of land around Mobile. The Clotilda illegally transported 110 captive people from what is now the west African nation of Benin to Alabama. The captain, William Foster, transferred women, men and children off the Clotilda once it arrived in Mobile and set fire to the ship to hide evidence of the journey. Most of Clotilda didn’t burn, and much of the ship is still in the Mobile River, which empties into Mobile Bay. Remnants of the Clotilda were discovered in 2019, and Meaher’s descendants released a statement last year calling his actions 160 years ago “evil and unforgivable.” The museum includes a brief history of the transatlantic slave trade and highlights the survivors of the 45-day journey from Africa, AL.com reported. It tells the story of its most famous passenger, Oluale Kossola, better known as Cudjoe Lewis. His interviews in the 1920s provided information about the Clotilda and its passengers to historians and scholars. Other ship survivors are highlighted, including Matlida McCrear, who died in 1940 in Selma, Alabama, and was the Clotilda’s last known survivor. McCrear was separated from her mother at a young age and tried to escape from a slaveholder when she was 3 years old. McCrear and her sister “fled into a swamp, hiding there for hours until dogs sniffed them out,” according to a display in the museum. “I think those who visit will really learn a lot about this particular story,” said Jeremy Ellis, president of the Clotilda Descendants Association and a sixth-generation descendant of Pollee and Rose Allen, who were enslaved and on the Clotilda. “It tells the story of west African culture, what the 110 experienced at the Middle Passage and the first five years of slavery and what they overcame in 1865 in the founding of Africatown.” Advertisement","pubDate":"2023-07-09 16:45:05","image_url":null,"source_id":"winnipegfreepress","category":["world"],"country":["canada"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ex-Edo PDP gov aspirant Ikhine, defects to APC","link":"https://punchng.com/ex-edo-pdp-gov-aspirant-ikhine-defects-to-apc/","keywords":["News, Politics"],"creator":["Adeyinka Olaseni"],"video_url":null,"description":"The Deputy Director General, Edo State Peoples Democratic Party Campaign Council for the re-election of Governor Godwin Obaseki in 2020, Engr.

Gideon Ikhine has dumped the party for the All Progressives Congress. In a letter of resignation addressed to the chairman, PDP Ward 7 (Ukpenu/ Ujolen/ Emuhi) Ekpoma, Esan West Local Government area and dated July 8, 2023, made available to journalists on Sunday, Ikhine, who was also an ex-governorship aspirant of the PDP in Edo State said it was a great honour contributing to the party in the last 24 years. The letter reads, “It has been a great honor to contribute to the growth and success of this party over the years, with People Democratic Party recording outstanding results from my Ward all through the 24 years of working with you. “My commitment to the people of Ward 7, Esan-West Local Government and Edo people remains firm and resolute to keep serving them in another capacity,” he added. Giving reasons on Sunday why he left the PDP, Ikhine said that the unending impasse in the PDP, which has pitched the Obaseki group against the legacy group was a major factor, nothing that it was going to be difficult to realise his ambition of serving his people.

He debunked the claim that he collected 1m dollars to step down for Obaseki in 2019, noting that he supported the governor based on his conviction that Obaseki had a good programme for the state. He also noted that he did not leave the party because of insinuations that the ticket had been zoned to Edo South. He said, “The impasse in the PDP was a major factor for my exit because I don’t feel I can realise my ambition in the state with the Obaseki and the legacy group still at loggerheads. I am taking 30 per cent of the membership of the PDP with me to APC. “I also worked with the APC in the last election because of some injustice and anomaly that was perpetuated in Esan in the last election.

To continue reading, please subscribe: + GST for 9 weeks of unlimited access* An Oklahoma judge has thrown out a lawsuit seeking reparations for the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, dashing an effort to obtain some measure of legal justice by survivors of the deadly racist rampage. Judge Caroline Wall on Friday dismissed with prejudice the lawsuit trying to force the city and others to make recompense for the destruction of the once-thriving Black district known as Greenwood. The order comes in a case by three survivors of the attack, who are all now over 100 years old and sued in 2020 with the hope of seeing what their attorney called “justice in their lifetime.” Spokespersons for the city of Tulsa and a lawyer for the survivors — Lessie Benningfield Randle, Viola Fletcher and Hughes Van Ellis — did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday. Wall, a Tulsa County District Court, wrote in a brief order that she was tossing the case based on arguments from the city, regional chamber of commerce and other state and local government agencies. She’d ruled against the defendants’ motions to dismiss and allowed the case to proceed last year. Local judicial elections in Oklahoma are technically nonpartisan, but Wall has described herself as a “Constitutional Conservative” in past campaign questionnaires. The lawsuit was brought under Oklahoma’s public nuisance law, saying the actions of the white mob that killed hundreds of Black residents and destroyed what had been the nation’s most prosperous Black business district continue to affect the city today. It contended that Tulsa’s long history of racial division and tension stemmed from the massacre, during which an angry white mob descended on a 35-block area, looting, killing and burning it to the ground. Beyond those killed, thousands more were left homeless and living in a hastily constructed internment camp. The city and insurance companies never compensated victims for their losses, and the massacre ultimately resulted in racial and economic disparities that still exist today, the lawsuit argued. It sought a detailed accounting of the property and wealth lost or stolen in the massacre, the construction of a hospital in north Tulsa and the creation of a victims compensation fund, among other things. A Chamber of Commerce attorney previously said that the massacre was horrible, but the nuisance it caused was not ongoing. Fletcher, who is 109 and the oldest living survivor, is set to release a memoir next month about the life she lived in the shadow of the massacre. In 2019, Oklahoma’s attorney general used the public nuisance law to force opioid drug maker Johnson & Johnson to pay the state $465 million in damages. The Oklahoma Supreme Court overturned that decision two years later. ___ Bleiberg reported from Dallas and staff writer Michael Biesecker contributed reporting from Washington.

When she got back from a holiday, she was told that she might have cancer. After a biopsy to confirm doctors' suspicions Sophie was told she had an 8cm tumour in her left breast. Her two children Reggie and Leo were just four and 12 years old at the time. Sophie said she \"wasn't prepared for that news at all,\" adding: \"I was terrified that I wouldn't be around to see my children grow up.\" Read more: The best photos from Saturday's Race For Life Pretty Muddy event in Cardiff Her treatment included six sessions of chemotherapy which caused her to lose her hair, eyebrows and eyelashes. She said: \"My youngest son Reggie didn’t understand why I’d lost my hair. He said ‘do I have to call you daddy now?’ because my husband had a shaved head as well.\" In April 2018 Sophie began a ten-year treatment on preventative drug Tamoxifen. She also underwent a left side mastectomy, surgery to remove lymph nodes and 15 sessions of radiotherapy. After around two years and a failed reconstruction surgery she had a successful reconstruction in December 2019.

I am hopeful that treatment will do its thing and keep me around for as long as possible.\" Now 37 and celebrating 20 years with her husband Gareth, Sophie says \"life's too short\" not to enjoy it, adding: \"You don't know what's 'round the corner. I will never take a birthday or life moment for granted because growing old is a true privilege.\" The family went to the Maldives on holiday and Sophie celebrated her 37th birthday with Gareth by going to Newcastle to see their favourite artist Sam Fender perform at St James' Park.

Sophie started the Pretty Muddy event on Saturday (Image: Mark Lewis) \"My cancer won't ever go away,\" Sophie said, \"and that is the hardest thing to have to accept. I'm not indestructible. I will have days when cancer knocks me down and I need to give myself time when it does. \"But I will always keep my fiery determination to keep pushing on, because cancer’s created its own worst enemy in me and I will keep pushing on no matter what. So, cancer, I’ll give you a day here and there, but that’s your lot because time’s ticking and this gal’s got s*** to do!\" Sophie is now determined to turn her experience into something positive and encourage people to raise money to fund essential research: \"Research is key for someone like me who relies on new treatments being developed to give me more time with my loved ones. The more treatments Cancer Research UK can fund means the longer I am here and the more chance I have of seeing my children do all the things a parent should be there for.\" The organisers of this year's events are sending a message of thanks to everyone involved and appealing for people to pay their sponsorship money as soon as possible.

Wichita police arrested the man Friday as a suspect in the shooting on July 2 at City Nightz in downtown Wichita. Nine people suffered gunshot wounds and two others were trampled in the chaos that followed the 1 a.m. shooting. No one died. It wasn’t immediately clear if the man has been charged. Police on Saturday also asked for the public’s assistance in finding a 23-year-old man they believe is connected to the shooting.

Sir Keir “thanked him for his presentation but said he wasn’t interested in hope and change ”, according to a source.

The economic impact payment, or the third stimulus check, was huge, comprising 54% of the total funds. The previous packages under the Trump administration placed a larger emphasis on business-directed assistance. The economic impact of the pandemic has been vast, even unmeasurable, and weighed most heavily on vulnerable populations, especially folks experiencing homelessness and poverty. The American Rescue Plan was hailed as a significant win for the Democrats by the media, especially for Americans living in poverty. Not only does the bill include direct stimulus payments to individuals making less than $75,000 and married couples filing jointly and making less than $150,000 a year. The Rescue Plan even provided a stimulus check to dependents and the amount was also $1,400, the same that was given to each filer. Other provisions that were included in the Rescue Plan included expanded benefits for the unemployed, an expanded version of the Child Tax Credit, and state investments aimed to help with the distribution of vaccines and the reopening of schools. A Columbia University report states that the package comprising both the additional investments in programs and the direct stimulus checks brought down poverty rates by 30% and reduced the number of children living in poverty by half. Universal Basic Income Preempts Economic Woes Unlike The Stimulus Checks Nobody doubted that the stimulus check was a step in the right direction. But there was also the question of the need to address economic woes through preemption rather than through mitigation. An alternative method to bring down individual financial instability and also reduce poverty is the concept of a universal basic income. The very word, universal, indicates that the UBI is for everyone, regardless of socioeconomic, employment, and housing status. And the crucial difference between the concept of universal basic income and stimulus checks is that the UBI concept provided direct stimulus checks to individuals for an extended period of time, if not for an unlimited period of time, unlike the one-off stimulus checks. The stimulus check has always been a sporadic effort and has been dependent upon legislation each time the payments were necessary. This sporadic nature of stimulus checks has led to a more extended system to support the American poor through the universal basic income model. Cities and local bodies have started the concept of universal basic through pilot projects, and they are steadily gaining success. Cities and states are now adopting the model while those who have passed through the pilot project routine are now expanding the concept. A basic income case project from Stockton in California was recently in the news. Two years ago a monthly stimulus check of $500 was given to 125 individuals who were selected randomly. The main criteria for selection were that these individuals were below the median income of the city of Stockton, which was $45,000 in a year. The recipients of the stimulus checks were able to spend the money as they wished. They were not obligated to complete any drug test, aset or means test, interviews, or even any work requirements. The beneficiaries just got the stimulus checks, no questions asked, no strings attached. The regular stimulus checks had a huge impact on those who received them. A comparison of those who received this monthly payment with those who did not show the glaring difference. The study showed that there was a marked decrease in income volatility and the figure was as significant as 22% for those who received the payments. It has been seen that the overwhelming number of beneficiaries were using the $500 to purchase only essentials such as food, utilities, and clothing. A second crucial discovery was that the stimulus checks did not dissuade people from looking for work or joining the workforce. Rather as households were now in a more stable position, they were free to now access resources that helped them progress further in their field of work. With a more stable financial position, they could not spend time looking for more permanent and sustainable work. Stimulus Check But the concept of a universal basic income is only opposed by the Republicans. Their major critiques are that it will dissuade people from joining the workforce, a line that is similar to what the Republicans used when they opposed the pandemic stimulus checks. The Stockton Stimulus Checks Challenged The Opposition By The Republicans The Stockton pilot project proved an eye-opener. For one, as has been mentioned before, the monthly stimulus checks did not dissuade people from going to work. Rather, it provided them the time to find suitable jobs and engage with their communities. There was even a rise in the percentage of jobs with full-time participants’ share growing by 12 percentage points as against only 5 percentage points in the control group. Secondly, the cost of moving out people of poverty also alleviated the economy in various areas. For instance, healthcare was a beneficiary. Toxic stress that has always been linked to finances is normally pervasive and also expensive for both the system and the individual. But the freeing up of resources will definitely serve the community in the long run. The former mayor of Stockton, Michael Tubbs stressed the point when he revealed that much of the societal illness is due to toxic stress and the high levels of cortisol and anxiety. These are directly linked to the volatility that low and moderate-income families usually face. Most families are just a payment away from being either thrown out on the streets or starvation and in most cases, both. The pain of not having enough to cover the necessities of your family is one of the most stressful situations that a parent can face. And that has become even more true post the pandemic.

In fact, it's more intense than ever.","content":"President Biden doesn’t brag much, but after only two-and-a-half years in the White House, he has been called the since Lyndon Johnson. Unfortunately, most Americans don’t realize all he’s done, so Biden is trying out some new bully pulpits to tell them. His first was a last week with MSNBC anchor Nicolle Wallace. But in addition to his accomplishments, Biden should continue he set off before last year’s midterm elections. The soul of America is still at risk from hatred, racism, violence and totalitarianism. Biden should emphasize he’s eager to lead the fight to restore decency, unity and our commitment to democracy, but he needs an army of voters fighting beside him. It turns out that exorcizing former President Trump from government isn’t as easy as removing him from the White House. His influence continues with his and he among the Republicans serving in Congress. That will not be corrected without a massive mobilization of voters to return control of Congress to the people. What’s more, SCOTUS itself is melting down — its are ruining the court’s reputation for integrity while its dramatic has made the court a purveyor of conservative dogma rather than justice. During his conversation with Wallace, Biden said he believes Congress and the Supreme Court will heal themselves. His faith in the self-healing power of institutions may be rooted in the kinder and gentler days when he . There was dignity, decorum and a desire for bipartisanship back then. But those days are long gone, and they won’t return until voters remove members of Congress who are hell-bent on partisanship.

The facts were fiction, and there was no injured party. It raises concerns the court is willing to issue rulings based on conservative objectives rather than actual cases. As the Campaign Legal Center , “The Roberts Court’s track record on Democracy is abysmal and continues to threaten the democratic rights that are essential to a functioning America. The only potential remedy is a strong pushback from Congress.” Why Congress? It has the power to justices who deserve it; from judicial review of specific bills; ; require the court to an ethics code; and restore EPA’s authority, the and women’s rights over their bodies.

A few more states would bring the total to 270, the number required to win the presidency and make the Electoral College meaningless. Biden’s call for reforms would resonate with the millions of Americans unhappy about the federal government. Gallup found in May that of Americans disapprove of how Congress handles its job. A majority, , disapproved of how the Supreme Court is behaving. “There is near-universal agreement that our system is not working well — in particular that it is not delivering the results people want,” last year. “[I]t is not surprising that public support is very high for fundamental change in our political system to make the system work better.” But public opinion alone does not protect democracy. It will always be under attack if voters keep electing the same bad actors to government.","pubDate":"2023-07-09 16:00:00","image_url":"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/06/bidenjoe_102022_ap-e1688154377301.jpg?w=900","source_id":"thehill","category":["politics"],"country":["united states of america"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Man arrested after stabbings at hotel and car dealership","link":"https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/uk-news/man-arrested-after-stabbings-hotel-27287714","keywords":["News"],"creator":["newsdesk@walesonline.co.uk (Richard Blackledge)"],"video_url":null,"description":"The victims were rushed to hospital following the incidents","content":"Two people are in hospital and a man has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after stabbings at a hotel and a car dealership today (Sunday, July 9).

Dad-of-two PC Phillips, 34, was on the central reservation of Wallasey Dock Link Road when he was hit by a car thief driving at high speed. He was killed instantly in the tragedy on October 5, 2015. It came after Clayton Ronald Williams had stolen a high-performance L200 Mitsubishi during an earlier burglary. PC Phillips was deploying a stop-stick puncturing device when he was struck by the car.

It is unknown if Williams and Chapman were associates. Chapman also posted a status condemning guns in a failed attempt to distance himself from his crimes, the Liverpool Echo reports. Chapman, 23, was this week found guilty of the murder of Elle Edwards who was killed in a botched gangland shooting. Elle, 26, had been enjoying a night out with her sister and friends when she was hit twice in the back of the head outside the Lighthouse pub in Wallasey Village. Elle Edwards (Image: PA) Five men were also injured - one critically - but all of them survived. A jury of seven women and five men came to a unanimous decision after three hours and 48 minutes of deliberation, following a three-and-a-half week trial at Liverpool Crown Court. Chapman’s friend Thomas Waring, 20, was convicted of possession of a prohibited weapon, and also assisting an offender by helping Chapman torch the stolen black Mercedes car used to flee the scene. Drug dealer Chapman was jailed for the reckless murder of Elle in what was the \"culmination\" of a violent, tit-for-tat feud between the Woodchurch group and its Wirral rival, a gang based around the Beechwood/Ford estate on the opposite side of the M53 motorway. Two of the men shot on Christmas Eve, Kieran Salkeld and Jake Duffy, were described as involved in the Beechwood gang and are already serving jail sentences for dishing out a savage beating to Woodchurch-linked Sam Searson, the day before the shooting. Salkeld was the most severely injured of the survivors after Chapman's bullet penetrated his chest causing internal bleeding and organ damage, while Duffy was wounded in both legs. Three other men injured by the volley of bullets; Harry Loughran, Liam Carr and Nicholas Speed, all described as “innocent bystanders”, made quicker recoveries.

Read this article for free: Already have an account? To continue reading, please subscribe: + GST for 9 weeks of unlimited access* WASHINGTON (AP) — After major blows to his agenda by the Supreme Court, President Joe Biden is intent on making sure voters will have the final say. When the court’s conservative majority effectively killed his plan to cancel or reduce federal student loan debts for millions of people, Biden said, “Republicans snatched away the hope that they were given.” When the justices ended race-based affirmative action in college admissions, he said, “This is not a normal court.” When they overturned Roe v. Wade and a national right to abortion last year, the president said, “Voters need to make their voices heard.” As Biden heads into the 2024 election, he is running not only against the Republicans who control one-half of Congress but also against the conservative bloc that dominates the nation’s highest court. It’s a subtle but significant shift in approach toward the Supreme Court, treating it more like a political entity even as Biden stops short of calling for an overhaul. That shift is becoming apparent in everything from the White House’s messaging to its legal strategy. “The president respects the court’s authority, but if its judgments are going to be political and there are members of the court who are saying that, he owes it to voters to make it clear what his positions are and what he’s doing to address it,” said Ron Klain, his former chief of staff. “Many members of the current court testified that Roe is settled law and still overturned it,” he added, referring to the court’s ruling on abortion. “That has its consequences.” Biden, who once led the Senate Judiciary Committee, is focusing on the politicization of the court as a way to encourage voters to back him. Yet he has not embraced any effort to make big changes to the court. Instead, Biden is increasingly vocal about his belief that the court is abandoning mainstream constitutional interpretation. He tells voters they need more Democrats in Congress and a Democrat in the White House to counter the impact of the conservative-leaning court. Biden has won his share of cases, including on immigration, before a court where conservatives hold a 6-3 majority. But the student loan defeat capped a term when justices imposed significant roadblocks. White House officials say Biden is keen to explore other ways to pursue the same priorities and explain to the American people about the obstacles. “There’s only upside in running against the court as an institution because the court is doing things that are wildly unpopular and they’re preventing the president from implementing his agenda,” said Chris Kang, chief counsel of the progressive group Demand Justice and a onetime deputy counsel to President Barack Obama. “I think that it’s important to make clear that the Supreme Court is making it impossible to implement and advance policies that should not have any controversy attached to them,” he added. Republicans are working to portray Biden as overstepping his legal authority in pursuit of his agenda. They say the high court’s policies are in step with much of the country and they are trying to motivate their own voters by highlighting what the GOP has achieved through court rulings. Former President Donald Trump, at the recent Faith and Freedom Coalition conference in Washington, praised the three justices he had nominated to the Supreme Court. “Exactly one year ago today, those justices were the pivotal votes in the Supreme Court’s landmark decision ending the constitutional atrocity known as Roe v. Wade,” Trump said. He drew a standing ovation by noting that “conservatives had been trying for 50 years,” to overturn that ruling. “But I got it done and nobody ever thought it was a possibility.” Other administration officials said the court’s conservative dominance has lowered the political cost to Biden when the justices scuttle some of his legally suspect actions such as on student loans and coronavirus mandates. On the latter, the Supreme Court struck down Biden’s attempt to require employees of large companies to get shots but left the requirement in place for health care workers, though by that time the pandemic had started to wane. Klain insisted that everything Biden has put forward had a solid legal basis and was approved by the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel. “There was no sense of taking the legal issues lightly or just ‘do it and take whatever the court says,’’ he said. Confidence in the Supreme Court fell to its lowest point in at least 50 years after the leaked draft opinion in the abortion case in 2022. Those who view the current court favorably are largely Republican. According to the Pew Research Center’s September 2022 report, only 28% of Democrats and Democrat-leaning independents now view the court favorably, down nearly 40 percentage points since 2020. And people in the United States increasingly favor term limits. Positive views of the court among Republicans and those who lean Republican has increased to 73%. As a result, the partisan gap is larger than at any other point in the 35 years of polling that Pew has done on the court. Republicans have focused for years on remaking the federal judiciary and Supreme Court. When Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-K.Y., was the majority leader, he refused to even meet in 2016 with Obama’s pick for the high court — current Attorney General Merrick Garland, a federal judge at that time. The nomination stalled until a Republican president, Trump, took over. Establishment GOP operatives backed Trump because of his pledge to name as many judges to the bench as possible. Their gamble worked. Trump ended up with three Supreme Court nominees and 54 federal appeals court judges, reshaping the courts for a generation. Democrats are now finally understanding the power of judges as a voting tool, and Biden has made judicial nominations a priority, appointing a record number of judges for a president at this point in his first term, including some of the most diverse picks yet to the judiciary. Biden aides plan on highlighting those accomplishments during the reelection campaign, but acknowledge it’s only a small salve to their troubles at the high court. Biden has taken to warning voters about what else the Supreme Court might do in the future, whether rolling back same-sex marriage rights or access to contraception. “President Biden is being direct with the American people about the stakes these extreme decisions that jettison decades of longstanding precedent have for their fundamental freedoms and their daily lives,” said White House spokesman Andrew Bates. Part of Biden’s unwillingness to go further to reshape the Supreme Court comes from a sense of history. Those pushing social change stood by the court after Brown v. Board of Education, a major civil rights case, and even Roe v. Wade, holding up its autonomy as a way to push forward. Backing away from that, particularly for an establishment Democrat like Biden, is not easy. As Biden said in an interview with MSNBC, “I think if we start the process of trying to expand the court, we’re going to politicize it maybe forever in a way that is not healthy,” Leah Litman, a professor of law at the University of Michigan and co-host of “Strict Scrutiny” podcast about the Supreme Court, said that while Biden was unlikely to go that far, “there are a variety of things that Democratic politicians could run on that would actually allow them to more explicitly push back against the court.” Besides expanding the size of the Supreme Court and or the lower courts, she said, other options include stripping the Supreme Court of jurisdiction over certain cases, setting term limits and implementing ethics changes. All of them, she said, are things the party could embrace “as part of their recognition that the court has politicized itself.” __ Follow the AP’s coverage of the U.S. Supreme Court at https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court Advertisement","pubDate":"2023-07-09 15:43:50","image_url":null,"source_id":"winnipegfreepress","category":["world"],"country":["canada"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Man sought in Nebraska homicide, armed carjacking shot and killed by police in Iowa","link":"https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/world/2023/07/09/man-sought-in-nebraska-homicide-armed-carjacking-shot-and-killed-by-police-in-iowa","keywords":["World"],"creator":["Feedloaderapi"],"video_url":null,"description":"COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa (AP) — A man sought in connection with a fatal shooting and an armed carjacking in Nebraska was shot and killed by police officers in Iowa following […]","content":"COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa (AP) — A man sought in connection with a fatal shooting and an armed carjacking in Nebraska was shot and killed by police officers in Iowa following a chase.

Police in Omaha, Nebraska, responded to a domestic assault call before 6 a.m. Saturday and learned that 41-year-old Matthew Briggs had broken into a home and assaulted a woman, police said in a news release. She was able to escape. Minutes later, police learned that Briggs drove his car through the garage door of a home nearby. The woman who lived there wasn’t home but Briggs shot at a neighbor who came over to check on him, police said. The neighbor was unhurt. Around 7 a.m., police were called to a third home and found 52-year-old Steven Donsbach shot to death. Briggs was named as a person of interest. On Saturday afternoon, a Toyota Camry was carjacked in suburban Omaha by a man matching Briggs’ description. Officers spotted the car and a pursuit began. The chase crossed into Iowa. In Council Bluff, the Toyota crashed and two officers — one from Omaha and one from Council Bluffs — shot Briggs. He died at a hospital. Omaha police did not say what prompted the shooting, but said two guns were found in the stolen car Briggs was driving. Both officers are on paid administrative pending an investigation by the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation.

To continue reading, please subscribe: + GST for 9 weeks of unlimited access* MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico’s armed forces are taking control of the capital’s main airport, and the government plans to give the military control of nearly a dozen more across the country as the president takes aim at corruption and mismanagement. President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has been setting the armed forces to a wide range of nontraditional tasks since he was elected in 2018, creating concerns about the separation of the military from civilian life. A new airport was built by the army outside Mexico City a year ago at a cost of $4.1 billion. It is run by the military but little used. López Obrador says the old airport, the country’s busiest, will be run by the navy. The navy took charge of security at Mexico City International Airport, or Benito Juárez, more than a year ago. It will soon have control of everything else, from customs and immigration to handling luggage and cleaning bathrooms, with the imminent publication of a presidential order to make that official. The list of problems at Mexico City Airport has long included major drug shipments and illegal migration. Infrastructure was in disrepair, and a number of close calls were reported on the runways in recent years as the airport increasingly had trouble handling flights. The airport also had a reputation for stolen luggage, mismanaged airline schedules, business without contracts and corruption. Meanwhile, López Obrador has gone to the armed forces for help throughout his term, giving them some immigration duties and control of ports and customs. They are also building major infrastructure projects such as a tourist train through the Yucatan Peninsula and a new airport in the same area. They even run plant nurseries and tourist trips to a former penal colony. The airport, which is used by some 4 million travelers each month, will be “a company within a naval military entity,” Rear Adm. Carlos Velázquez Tiscareño, the airport’s 73-year-old director, said in a recent interview. But, he said, “this is not going to look like a military department.” Unlike the capital’s other airport, Felipe Angeles, where National Guard troops take passenger tickets at the gate, at Benito Juarez the only uniformed military are the 1,500 marines deployed since February 2022 for security. The rest of the airport personnel will be civilians but “with clearer rules … that govern with more order and discipline,” Velázquez Tiscareño said. The navy will form a company called Casiopea to run the airport and six others that have “deficiencies” and are “in the hands of organized crime,” Velázquez Tiscareño said. Among them will be Matamoros, across the border from Texas, and Playa del Carmen on the Gulf of Mexico. López Obrador has already said that he plans to have a dozen airports in the hands of the army or navy by the end of his administration in 2024. And by the end of this year, the military is scheduled to begin operating its own commercial airline. The Mexico City takeover runs contrary to international aviation recommendations that clearly distinguish between military and civilian, said Rogelio Rodríguez Garduño, an aviation law expert at Mexico’s National Autonomous University. But the legal consequences of the move remain unclear. Earlier this year, Mexico’s Supreme Court ruled that the transfer of the National Guard from civilian to military control was unconstitutional. López Obrador left the guard under a civilian department but with a military operational chief. While navy operational control could help some security issues, experts don’t believe it will resolve other problems. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration downgraded Mexico’s aviation safety rating in 2021, preventing Mexican airlines from expanding flights to the U.S. FAA safety ratings of other countries are designed to measure those countries’ oversight of their airlines but do not mean that the airlines are unsafe. In Mexico, corruption got to the point years ago that coded messages were sent using airport internal communications to hold up baggage inspections so drug shipments could pass untouched, according to testimony during the U.S. trial of former Public Security Secretary Genaro Luna. He was convicted of drug trafficking in February. Mexico City has the country’s most important airport, and the navy is the branch of Mexican security forces in which the U.S. authorities have the most confidence, but the U.S. has not commented on the increasing power of the Mexican military. “There are various airports in the country that have had big problems for many years, and they had to be fixed,” said Velázquez Tiscareño, himself a retired pilot. In the past year, the navy’s security oversight has shut down some illegal business inside the airport, improved inspections and reduced stolen luggage, Velázquez Tiscareño said. Some airport workers confirm that, but note too that complaints about flight delays continue. “The navy has put things under greater control, but now we need to see how they’re going to work,” said José Beltrán, 72, who picks up trash at the airport. “It’s more peaceful,” said Luis Martinez, who’s been working at the airport for 25 years, helping passengers who need wheelchairs. But, he said, “people have the same complaints: flight delays and problems with luggage.” Rodríguez Garduño said Mexican aviation needs more money, more training and inspection regimes, among other measure, to raise its competitiveness on the global stage. He said he was not sure if the military could help solve all those problems.

In its second weekend in theaters, the Disney release was usurped by another franchise fifth – “ Insidious: The Red Door.” The horror film starring and directed by Patrick Wilson scared up $32.7 million in ticket sales from 3,188 theaters, according to studio estimates on Sunday. It did better than the last installment, “Insidious: The Last Key,” from 2018 and is the most any PG-13 horror movie has earned in its debut in the past two years. “Insidious 5” was not well reviewed — but modestly budgeted scary movies are often critic-proof when it comes to the box office. This Blumhouse-produced franchise starring Wilson and Rose Byrne began in 2011 under the direction of James Wan and has been responsible for over $570 million in global box office returns — and none of the films have cost more than $16 million to produce. Only the first movie received a “fresh” rating on Rotten Tomatoes; The “Insidious” films more often garner sub 40% scores. It was shrewd of Sony to release “Insidious” on the weekend between two Hollywood tentpoles, in this case “ Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny ” and “ Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part I,” which opens on Wednesday. “Indiana Jones 5” took second place in its second weekend with $26.5 million in North America (down 56% from its opening), bringing its domestic total to $121.2 million. Globally it’s earned an estimated $247.9 million. “ Joy Ride ” also made its theatrical debut this weekend in 2,820 locations and earned an underwhelming $5.9 million. The R-rated comedy directed and co-written by Adele Lim follows four friends on an international trip, played by Ashley Park, Sherry Cola, Stephanie Hsu and Sabrina Wu. The modestly budgeted Lionsgate release got rave reviews out of the South by Southwest Film Festival and maintains a 91% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, but it didn’t motivate big crowds this weekend. Those that did go (58% women, 72% over age 25, according to PostTrak) gave it a B- CinemaScore, suggesting the movie did not meet expectations, which can sometimes be because of how the film was marketed. The hope is that word-of-mouth might help “Joy Ride” in the coming weeks. “Joy Ride” is one of several raunchy, adult comedies in theaters this summer, including the Jennifer Lawrence movie “No Hard Feelings,” which earned $5.2 million in its third weekend, bringing its domestic total to $40.3 million. In more limited release, “The Lesson,” a literary chamber thriller starring Richard E. Grant and Daryl McCormack, opened to $157,752 from 268 screens.

The day is a public holiday, as per the 201 Nunavut Day Holiday Order, and commemorates the passing of two Nunavut acts. Nunavut Day marks the day when the Parliament of Canada passed the Nunavut Act, officially declaring Nunavut as a distinct region that is legally separate from the Northwest Territories along with the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement. On July 9, 1993, the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement Act took effect, and the Nunavut was established on April 1, 1999. The day was declared an official government holiday in the year 2001. As we celebrate Nunavut Day 2023, here’s all you need to know about the history and significance of the day. Canada Joins Global Movement, Bans Use of Animals To Test Cosmetic Products. Nunavut Day 2023 will be celebrated on Sunday, July 9. The Parliament of Canada passed the Nunavut Act on July 9, 1993, following the passing of the 1982 plebiscite on the question of the division of the Northwest Territories. The Act led to the establishment of the territory of Nunavut. On April 1, 1999, Nunavut became a legally distinct territory from the Northwest Territories. The following year, in 2000, 'Nunavut Day' was celebrated on April 1. However, it was felt that the 1993 Nunavut Land Claims Agreement had greater significance to the people of Nunavut, so the holiday was moved to July 9. Nunavut Day holds great significance for the people of Nunavut, Canada, as the day marks the formation of this territory. Nunavut Day is a perfect opportunity for people to honour the efforts of those who helped to bring this territory into being. An important symbol of Nunavut Territory is a blue and white image of a polar bear on an iceberg with a star in the sky. On July 9, 1993, the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement Act took effect, and Nunavut was established on April 1, 1999. The word ‘Nunavut’ means ‘our land’ in the native language Inuktitut. On Nunavut Day, people organize cultural activities like community-wide breakfasts, traditional games, food fest and other events and celebrate this historic day.

To continue reading, please subscribe: + GST for 9 weeks of unlimited access* NEW YORK (AP) — An influencer-backed energy drink that has earned viral popularity among children is facing scrutiny from lawmakers and health experts over its potentially dangerous levels of caffeine. On Sunday, Sen. Charles Schumer called on the Food and Drug Administration to investigate PRIME, a beverage brand founded by the YouTube stars Logan Paul and KSI that has become something of an obsession among the influencers’ legions of young followers. “One of the summer’s hottest status symbols for kids is not an outfit, or a toy—it’s a beverage,” said Schumer, a Democrat from New York. “But buyer and parents beware because it’s a serious health concern for the kids it so feverishly targets.” Backed by two of YouTube’s best known stars, PRIME was an immediate sensation when it launched last year, prompting long lines in grocery stores and reports of school yard resale markets. Advertising itself as zero sugar and vegan, the neon-colored cans are among a growing number of energy drinks with elevated levels of caffeine; in PRIME’s case, 200 milligrams per 12 ounces, equivalent to about half a dozen Coke cans or nearly two Red Bulls. That high content prompted bans from some schools in the United Kingdom and Australia where some pediatricians warned of possible health impacts on young children such as heart problems, anxiety, and digestive issues. Company representatives, meanwhile, have defended the product as clearly labeled “not recommended for children under 18.” They sell a separate sports drink, known as PRIME Hydration, which contains no caffeine at all. Representatives for PRIME did not immediately return a request for comment. But in his letter to the FDA, Schumer claimed there was little noticeable difference in the online marketing of the two drinks – leading many parents to believe they were purchasing a juice for their kids, only to wind up with a “cauldron of caffeine.” “A simple search on social media for Prime will generate an eye-popping amount of sponsored content, which is advertising,” he wrote. “This content and the claims made should be investigated, along with the ingredients and the caffeine content in the Prime energy drink.” Advertisement","pubDate":"2023-07-09 15:28:25","image_url":null,"source_id":"winnipegfreepress","category":["world"],"country":["canada"],"language":"english"},{"title":"People vow to never eat crabsticks again after video shows how they are made","link":"https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/uk-news/people-vow-never-eat-crabsticks-27287556","keywords":["News"],"creator":["newsdesk@walesonline.co.uk (Niamh Kirk, Howard Lloyd)"],"video_url":null,"description":"The 'world's largest crab stick factory' has shown how they produce the fishy snacks","content":"Crabsticks may not be as popular as they once were, but they remain a popular snack for many.

Sold widely around the UK, the savoury sticks are a go-to for some seafood lovers, but after a video was posted, people are disgusted and are now branding it a 'fish hot-dog'.

The frozen fish meat blocks are put through a machine and crushed up to create a grey paste, before travelling along a conveyor belt where salt and other flavourings are added. It all becomes very dull looking, and is a far cry from what we're used to seeing on the supermarket shelves. The fishy mix is then blended with ice as well as vegetable oil and sugars. Workers are seen putting it through a tube which transforms it into a huge whipped, grey pile of paste, before it gets moulded into strips and dyed the distinct colour and shape. Once dyed, it is wrapped in the classic packaging and frozen ready to head to our shelves.

People have been quick to comment on the video, with one person dubbing the sticks as \"hot dogs of the sea\". Another said \"the only ingredient I could identify was the ice\" Meanwhile, someone else jibed: \"Everything ok hun? You've hardly touched your grey\" due to the colour of the original paste. Another person said: \"Bet that place smells wonderful\" A third added: \"If the title hadn't specified they were making crabsticks, or in fact any type of food, I would've gotten to 1:38 before I realised that they weren't making some sort of industrial building material.\"","pubDate":"2023-07-09 15:11:39","image_url":"https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/article27287575.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_Crab-sticks.jpg","source_id":"walesonline","category":["politics","health","top","world"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"BBC suspends presenter over claims he paid a teenager for explicit photos","link":"http://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2023/jul/09/bbc-suspends-presenter-over-claims-he-paid-a-teenager-for-explicit-photos-2593063.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Though the age of sexual consent in Britain is 16, it's a crime to make or possess indecent images of anyone under 18.

Read this article for free: Already have an account? To continue reading, please subscribe: + GST for 9 weeks of unlimited access* There are 9.2 million lead pipes in the U.S. They contaminate drinking water with lead, which damages brain development in children. But around the country, utilities have been ignoring the opportunity to remove lead pipe when they uncover it during work on water mains. They’ve often removed a short pipe section, reburied the connection and left the rest. Research shows this method can actually spike, rather than reduce, lead levels. The sections of pipe that remain can contaminate tap water until they’re removed. The practice is also more expensive in the long run, since crews presumably will have to return someday. Here are some takeaways from The Associated Press investigation: LEAD IS HARMFUL Lead is a health threat and the practice of leaving sections of the old pipe behind should have stopped a long time ago, according to Yanna Lambrinidou, a medical anthropologist at Virginia Tech and co-founder of the Campaign for Lead Free Water. Lead is especially dangerous to young children. It can lower IQ and deprive kids of cognitive skills. The Environmental Protection Agency says no amount is safe for kids. She said utilities have tried to dodge responsibility to reduce costs. “I can’t but think of partial replacements as immoral because they involve a witting decision by government agencies to leave residents at continued risk of exposure,” said Lambrinidou. Yet the practice has played out hundreds of thousands of times, in cities including Providence and Chicago. It continues today in Oklahoma City, Allentown, Pennsylvania, Nashville and Memphis, Tennessee, and St. Louis. PROVIDENCE HAS STRUGGLED In 2005, Providence Water changed the chemicals it adds to drinking water to lower levels of lead. Instead it caused them to jump — above EPA limits. That triggered an EPA requirement for Providence to remove some of its pipe, but the language of the regulation does not require entire lengths to be dug up. There, as in many cities, homeowners and the utility each own part of the water line. Providence generally removed only the part it said it was responsible for. By 2011, however, EPA scientists were weighing in, saying this method doesn’t actually lower levels of lead in water. Providence was still in the middle of a lead crisis with its water. Yet despite the fact that its practice didn’t work and could even make things worse, the city continued the approach when it worked on mains, only taking out entire lengths of lead pipe if the homeowner paid for it. Activists said Providence Water thus created a two-tiered system: one for people who could afford safe water and one for those who couldn’t. UTILITIES SAY IT’S COMPLICATED Removing lead pipes isn’t just the responsibility of the utility, but also individuals and government, said Steve Via, director of government relations at the American Water Works Association, a group that represents utilities. He said divided ownership of lead pipes, is “still a barrier to full lead service line replacement today.” In many communities, local rules forbid spending money to upgrade private property, blocking the work, Via said. Providence Water General Manager Ricky Caruolo said lead pipe replacement couldn’t be done without raising rates and he didn’t think it was his decision to force ratepayers to bear the cost of replacing lead pipes that are, in the end, privately owned. Most people don’t have a lead pipe, he said, so they wouldn’t benefit. That decision “needs to be made at the state or even federal level.” Caruolo also said some homes have lead fittings that will remain a risk even once the lead pipe is gone. He said officials have addressed lead head-on, improving water treatment, educating the public about lead and providing no-interest loans for removal. 2021 held some good news for Providence. The city’s results improved and are now within federal limits, much safer for young children today. CHICAGO SHOWS WHY SO MUCH REMAINS As weak as the order was in Providence, the EPA rarely goes even that far. Take the case of Chicago. About 7% of homes sampled last year exceeded federal limits. But that’s not enough to force officials there to remove the problem. State and local officials say they had limited funds and used them elsewhere. They also say local rules made removal work more difficult and expensive. Wednesdays A weekly look towards a post-pandemic future. So, three decades after the federal government imposed lead limits for drinking water, the vast majority of lead pipes are still in the ground not only in Chicago, but across the country. The Biden administration has said it wants them all removed. ___ Camille Fassett contributed reporting from Seattle.

Mudavadi said he had held several conversations with the former Head of state who told him he handed power peacefully because Ruto was the winner of the hotly contested presidential election. “If they think they can change anything now, then they are totally wrong. I have been with Uhuru in peacekeeping mission engagements in Abuja and Bujumbura. “He said he handed power and all the legal instruments peacefully.

The Met Office picked up the ants on a rain radar on Friday as people took to social media reporting sightings saying it was “flying ant day”. The forecaster said the winged insects are usually picked up on their radars at this time of the year over the space of about a week. The swarms appear on the radars and look similar to rainfall, but the Met Office can check their weather gauges to confirm if it is rain or flying ants. They creatures are less likely to fly in the rain and it is harder for the Met Office to tell if it is ants or the rainfall during wet weather, Simon Partridge, a forecaster for the Met Office, said. He added: “Every year around this time we do pick them up on the rain radar. At the moment it’s harder to tell because we’ve got so many showers and the ants look like showers. “When we do get the rain, they don’t fly as much. “It’s generally the southern parts of the UK where we tend to notice it most.

On Friday it was about a mile. “They’re an interesting phenomenon and it’s always this time of year and usually over about a week or so.” Flying ants are spotted when males and new queens leave the nest to mate, with many ant colonies doing so on the same day.

He has been replaced by Colonel-General Mikhail Teplinskiy, according to The Moscow Times citing pro-war Telegram channels. Putin has not officially confirmed the move. Gerasimov will remain in charge of the Russian armed forces overall as Chief of the General Staff, however, it’s unclear where the general is at the moment - he hasn’t been seen since the Wagner rebellion.

Mark Schiefelbein | Afp | Getty Images After a high stakes four-day trip to China , U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said she had a \"constructive visit\" and a \"very substantive series of meetings\" with Chinese officials about the state of the global economy, export controls and national security. Yellen's trip is part of ongoing efforts to stabilize U.S.-China relations after months of escalating tensions. Her visit came just weeks after Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit last month. These efforts could ultimately pave the way for a meeting between U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the G-20 leaders' summit in New Delhi in September and the APEC leaders' summit in San Francisco in November. Both leaders last met in Bali last year. \"We have a new team on the economic side in Beijing, that it's important to establish person-to-person relationships, and to open ongoing channels of communication, where concerns can be aired and discussed,\" Yellen told CBS' \"Face the Nation\" Sunday. \"And I do think my trip has been successful in forging those relationships and creating the opportunity for a deeper set of more frequent contacts at our staff levels.\" Yellen's task in Beijing was complex. She said she raised a number of concerns, including national security and the intimidation some American companies have been experiencing, but she also sought Chinese cooperation on issues ranging from climate change to debt distress. Yellen said her purpose was to make sure the two nations do not engage in \"unintended escalatory actions that will be harmful to our overall economic relationship with one another.\" For instance, just days before Yellen's visit, Beijing slapped export curbs on chipmaking metals and compounds. China's Ministry of Commerce claimed it gave the U.S. and Europe advance notice. In October, the U.S. launched sweeping rules aimed at cutting off exports of key chips and semiconductor tools to China. Yellen said she expressed concern about the export controls and contrasted it with the U.S. decision. She explained that the U.S.' actions \"are narrowly targeted to address national security concerns,\" while it is not clear that the Chinese export controls were implemented for that same reason. \"We have had very little contact, both senior officials, and also just the American people and the Chinese people who've had very little contact with one another over the last several years, in part because of Covid,\" Yellen said. \"And that's a situation where misunderstandings can develop.\" Yellen said China is also taking steps to address concerns about a slowing economy, and that there are opportunities for American businesses to profit. But even so, she said national security remains a priority for the U.S. \"China has an enormous market. It's a significant share of the global economy, and we want to make sure that American businesses and workers can profit from that, and contribute also to China's success as well as our own,\" Yellen said. \"But there are areas where national security really demands that the most advanced technologies with military applications, we need to withhold to protect our own national security. And we have acted and will continue to act to do that.\" — CNBC's Clement Tan contributed to this report.","pubDate":"2023-07-09 14:51:47","image_url":null,"source_id":"cnbc","category":["politics"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"GACHAGUA mocks RAILA ODINGA for collecting signatures to impeach RUTO – It is a total waste of time for a LOSER!","link":"https://kenyan-post.com/2023/07/gachagua-mocks-raila-odinga-for-collecting-signatures-to-impeach-ruto-it-is-a-total-waste-of-time-for-a-loser/","keywords":["Politics"],"creator":["Guru"],"video_url":null,"description":"Sunday, July 9, 2023 – Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua has mocked former Prime Minister Raila Odinga for starting to collect signatures to ‘remove’ the Kenya Kwanza administration from power.

Governor Makinde, who lauded the people of the state for their support for his administration in the first four years and their support during the election, said he would never take that support for granted. “From the bottom of my heart I cannot take your support for granted. You have supported us for a second tenure and you must support us to have a successful tenure because, if we are successful, Oyo State is successful and the impact will definitely be on all of us,” the governor said. A statement by the Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Sulaimon Olanrewaju, indicated that Governor Makinde stated this at the Omituntun 2.0 Victory Invitational Golf Tournament Dinner, held at the Ibadan Golf Club, Ibadan. The governor appreciated his friends for putting the event together, noting that he would continue to strive to develop the game of Golf and ensure it is played across the state. This was as he reiterated that his administration would continue to put in the hard work necessary to put the state on the path of sustainable development. He, noted, however, that there was the need to continue to support the administration so that it could achieve its set goals of uplifting the state and bringing about sustainable development. The governor added that he would be receptive to constructive criticisms and ideas that could help move the state forward and that residents who have concerns about the spread of government’s efforts to their localities should feel free to express such. POLL He said: “This is an event organised completely by my friends and associates. I want to let you know that a dime did not come from me nor from the coffers of Oyo State for this event. “Let me thank the good people of Oyo State and all of you seated here for your support. Some of you may not have supported me directly but I am aware that you did that indirectly. “People may not know that I do monitor the Whatsapp loop of this Club and I know those that criticise me. But once God has vindicated one, there is no need to engage in any sort of fight further. Yes, we can disagree to agree, in as much as the end result is to make our society better. “So, I will say that even under Omituntun 2.0, you can challenge and tell us where we are not doing well. Tell us when good projects have not gotten to your neighbourhood and we won’t take it personal but, instead, address your genuine concerns. Victory is sweet after the hard work. For the past almost six weeks after we were sworn in for the second tenure in office, we have just been enjoying ourselves. “I know it is time to roll up our sleeves and get to work again.

Matthew Woodward, of Barry , was fatally injured at around 4.25am on Friday in a collision involving his motorbike and a car. The driver of the car also died in the crash between Bonvilston and Cowbridge. One of Matthew's closest friends Oscar Jenkins has paid tribute to the 33-year-old who is survived by three-year-old daughter Amelia and fiancée Lauren Goodman. Oscar, whose fundraiser to support the family has already seen £3,695 in donations, told WalesOnline that Matthew was riding his motorbike home following a lorry-driving shift when the collision happened. Matthew was using the bike because he had sold his car a couple of weeks earlier following a sharp rise in the family's mortgage payments, said Oscar. Oscar, also 33, added: \"Woody was the most gentle and kind-hearted person and that's not just me saying it as a good friend. He was very softly spoken and sensitive without a bad bone in his body. We'd known each other since the start of secondary school in Shrewsbury. He met Lauren at university in Swansea and she's got quite a big family in Barry so he moved down there and they had a child. But he was always the one who made that push to get together with our group of friends from Shrewsbury whenever possible.\" Matthew Woodward is survived by fiancée Lauren and daughter Amelia Read next: Man seriously injured in Cardiff stabbing Four days before his death Matthew visited Oscar in Shrewsbury. \"It felt like an absolute blessing because it had been a while since I'd seen him,\" said Oscar. \"His fiancée had by pure chance arranged to have her eyebrows done in the area so he popped in to see us on Monday. It had been my birthday a couple of weeks before that and Woody hadn't been able to make it so he ordered a curry takeaway, brought four or five beers, and said: 'This is for missing your birthday.' We sat down and it was lovely. \"He was talking about the cost of living and how he was thinking of moving away from being a lorry driver and becoming a train driver. A week or two earlier he'd sold his BMW because the mortgage rates had gone up so much. Looking back it's so incredible that we had that opportunity to see him a final time.\" Matthew Woodward with fiancée Lauren Some of Oscar's favourite moments with Matthew came in charity soapbox races. Matthew, a former employee of the Rednal Karting track, loved motoring. He helped Oscar, whose aunt died of brain cancer, design a pink go-kart out of plumbing insulation to look like a brain and used it to fundraise for cancer research in a series of races including Penarth Downhill Derby. \"It was the most ridiculous-looking go-kart but Woody was such an incredible driver that he managed to steer this thing and beat all these local engineering firms. They couldn't believe it. The last two years he won the Penarth race both times. He was such a gentle soul but when he got on a racetrack it was like he had an ultra-competitive alter ego. Racing was his absolute love. We raised about £2,500 in total over five races across the country.\" The couple were engaged Oscar added that caring for family and friends was extremely important to Matthew. He gave the example of a kind gesture towards a friend who needed a car but was struggling for cash. \"Woody transferred a number of thousands of pounds to make sure he got the car he wanted and said: 'Pay me back when you can.' He was very generous with his friends.\" The GoFundMe campaign will go towards supporting Matthew's family and helping with funeral costs. You can donate here .

Biden's first stop will be in London, where he will meet British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak at 10 Downing Street on Monday and then travel to Windsor Castle for a visit with King Charles. The talks with the king, expected to include climate initiatives, will give Biden a greater sense of the man who succeeded his mother, Queen Elizabeth, who died last September. Biden had tea with the queen at Windsor in June 2021 and they discussed many of the same issues that remain a top priority today, like Russia and China. Biden will travel on to Vilnius, Lithuania, on Monday night and hold talks with NATO leaders there on Tuesday and Wednesday. Biden and the allies aim to show support for Ukraine and give Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy a sense of what he will have to do to gain NATO membership at some point in the future. In a CNN interview previewing his trip, Biden urged caution for now on Ukraine's drive to join NATO, saying the alliance could get drawn into the war with Russia due to NATO's mutual defense pact. \"I don't think there is unanimity in NATO about whether or not to bring Ukraine into the NATO family now, at this moment, in the middle of a war,\" Biden said. A centerpiece of Biden's visit to Lithuania will be a speech that he will deliver at Vilnius University on Wednesday night. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters the speech will cover Biden's vision of \"a strong, confident America flanked by strong, confident allies and partners taking on the significant challenges of our time, from Russia's aggression in Ukraine to the climate crisis.\" One of Biden's objectives on the trip is to show Americans back home the importance of continuing support for Ukraine as he faces re-election. Some of his Republican rivals in the race for the November 2024 presidential elections have voiced doubts about his strategy. Solid majorities of Americans support providing weaponry to Ukraine to defend itself against Russia and believe that such aid demonstrates to China and other US rivals a will to protect US interests and allies, according to a Reuters/Ipsos survey late last month.

Petras Malukas | AFP | Getty Images As the Russian invasion of Ukraine continues with no end in sight, NATO's much-celebrated unity faces fresh strains when leaders gather for their annual summit this week in Vilnius, Lithuania. The world's biggest security alliance is struggling to reach an agreement on admitting Sweden as its 32nd member. Military spending by member nations lags behind long-standing goals. An inability to compromise over who should serve as NATO's next leader forced an extension of the current secretary-general's term for an extra year. Perhaps the most difficult questions are over how Ukraine should be eased into NATO. Some maintain admitting Ukraine would fulfill a promise made years ago and be a necessary step to deter Russian aggression in Eastern Europe. Others fear it would be seen as a provocation that could spiral into an even wider conflict. \"I don't think it's ready for membership in NATO,\" President Joe Biden told CNN in an interview airing Sunday. He said joining NATO requires countries to \"meet all the qualifications, from democratization to a whole range of other issues.\" He said the United States should provide long-term security assistance to Ukraine — \"the capacity to defend themselves\" — as it does with Israel. Read more about Russia's war on Ukraine: Russia reports intercepting a missile over annexed Crimea Biden is heading to Europe. A king and a war are on his agenda Wagner fighters preparing to move to Belarus, commander says Bickering among friends is not uncommon, and the current catalog of disputes pales in comparison with past fears that Donald Trump would turn his back on the alliance during his presidency. But the current challenges come at a moment when Biden and his counterparts are heavily invested in demonstrating harmony among members. \"Any fissure, any lack of solidarity provides an opportunity for those who would oppose the alliance,\" said Douglas Lute, U.S. ambassador to NATO under President Barack Obama. Russian President Vladimir Putin is eager to exploit divisions as he struggles to gain ground in Ukraine and faces political challenges at home, including the aftermath of a brief revolt by the Wagner mercenary group. \"You don't want to present any openings,\" Lute said. \"You don't want to present any gaps or seams.\" By some measures, the war in Ukraine has reinvigorated NATO, which was created at the beginning of the Cold War as a bulwark against Moscow. NATO members have poured military hardware into Ukraine to help with its counteroffensive, and Finland ended a history of nonalignment to become NATO's 31st member. \"I think it's appropriate to look at all the success,\" Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky told The Associated Press. \"So I think the invasion has strengthened NATO — exactly the opposite of what Putin anticipated.\" He noted Germany's shift toward a more robust defense policy as well as an increase in military spending in other countries. The latest test of NATO solidarity came Friday with what Biden said was a \"difficult decision\" to provide cluster munitions to Ukraine. More than two-thirds of alliance members have banned the weapon because it has a track record for causing many civilian casualties. The U.S., Russia and Ukraine are not among the more than 120 countries that have not signed a convention outlawing the use of the bombs. As for Ukraine's possible entry into NATO, the alliance said in 2008 that Kyiv eventually would become a member. Since then, little action has been taken toward that goal. Putin occupied parts of Ukraine in 2014 and then tried to capture the capital in 2022 with his invasion. \"A gray zone is a green light for Putin,\" said Daniel Fried, a former U.S. ambassador to Poland who is now a distinguished fellow at the Atlantic Council. The U.S. and Germany insist that the focus should be on supplying weapons and ammunition to Ukraine, rather than taking the more provocative step of extending a formal invitation to join NATO. Countries on NATO's Eastern flank — Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland — want firmer assurances on future membership. Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, is pushing for that as well. During a visit to the Czech Republic on Thursday, he said the \"ideal\" result of the Vilnius summit would be an invitation for his country to join the alliance. NATO could decide to elevate its relationship with Ukraine, creating what would be known as the NATO-Ukraine Council and giving Kyiv a seat at the table for consultations. Also in the spotlight in Vilnius will be Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the main obstacle to Sweden's attempts to join NATO alongside neighbor Finland. Erdogan accuses Sweden of being too lenient on anti-Islamic demonstrations and militant Kurdish groups that have waged a long insurgency in Turkey. Sweden recently changed its anti-terrorism legislation and lifted an arms embargo on Turkey. But a man burned a Quran outside a mosque in Stockholm last week, and Erdogan signaled that this would pose another hurdle. He equated \"those who permitted the crime\" to those who perpetrated it. Turkey and the U.S. are also at an impasse over the sale of F-16 fighter jets. Erdogan wants the upgraded planes, but Biden says Sweden's NATO membership has to be dealt with first. It's not the first time that Erdogan has sought to use a NATO summit for Turkish gain. In 2009, he held up the nomination of Anders Fogh Rasmussen as secretary-general but agreed to the move after securing some senior posts for Turkish officials at the alliance. Max Bergmann, a former State Department official who leads the Europe Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said there's growing frustration among allies toward Erdogan, building on concerns about his ties to Putin, democratic backsliding and sanctions evasion. \"They've tried playing nice,\" Bergmann said. \"The question is whether it's time to get much more confrontational.\" Hungary's prime minister, Viktor Orban, is also delaying his country's approval of Sweden's membership. In response, Idaho Sen. Jim Risch, the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is blocking a $735 million U.S. arms sale to Hungary. \"We don't want members who aren't interested in doing everything possible to strengthen the alliance rather than the pursuit of their own or individual interests,\" Risch said. \"I'm just sick and tired of it.\" But he rejected the idea that these disagreements are a sign of weakness within NATO. \"These are kinds of things that always arise in an alliance,\" he said. \"The fact that we've been able to deal with them and will continue to deal with them proves that this is the most successful and strongest military alliance in the history of the world.\" At least one potentially difficult issue is off the summit agenda. Rather than seek consensus on a new NATO leader, members agreed to extend the tenure of Jens Stoltenberg, who's held the job since 2014, for a year. It's his fourth extension. Most members wanted a woman to be the next secretary-general, and Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen had been considered a favorite. But Poland insisted on a candidate from the Baltic states because there had already been two Nordic secretaries general in a row. (Stoltenberg was a Norwegian prime minister and Rasmussen was a Danish prime minister.) Others are skeptical of accepting a nominee from the Baltics, whose leaders tend to be more provocative in their approach to Russia, including supporting Ukraine's desire to rapidly join NATO. More disagreements loom over NATO's updated plans for countering any invasion that Russia might launch on allied territory. It's the biggest revision since the Cold War, and Skip Davis, a former NATO official who is now a senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis, said it could involve \"lots of arm wrestling and card trading.\" \"That's an issue that will cause tension and dissent, and that's not what the Vilnius summit is all about,\" he said.","pubDate":"2023-07-09 14:27:41","image_url":null,"source_id":"cnbc","category":["politics"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"BBC releases statement after suspending presenter following teen sex pic allegations","link":"https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/uk-news/bbc-releases-statement-after-suspending-27285898","keywords":["News"],"creator":["newsdesk@walesonline.co.uk (Howard Lloyd)"],"video_url":null,"description":"The organisation has confirmed that a male member of staff has been suspended","content":"A BBC presenter has been suspended following accusations that one of its biggest presenters paid a teenager more than £35,000 for sexually explicit photos.

Chicago learned that the hard way in 1995. That July, a weeklong heat wave that hit 106 degrees Fahrenheit (41 degrees Celsius) Most of the deaths occurred in poor and majority Black neighborhoods, where many elderly or isolated people suffered without proper ventilation or air conditioning. Power outages from an overwhelmed grid made it all worse. Initially slow to react, Chicago has since developed emergency heat response plans that include a massive push to alert the public and then connect the most vulnerable to the help they may need. Other cities like Los Angeles, Miami and Phoenix now have \"chief heat officers\" to coordinate planning and response for dangerous heat. Around the world, cities and countries have adopted similar measures. But experts warn those steps might not be enough and with continuing inequality in who is most vulnerable. \"I don't know a single city that is truly prepared for that some climate scientists fear,\" said Eric Klinenberg, a professor of social sciences at New York University who wrote a book about the Chicago heat wave. Heat preparedness has generally improved over the years as forecasting has become more accurate, and as meteorologists, journalists and government officials have focused on spreading the word of upcoming danger. Chicago, for example, has expanded its emergency text and email notification system and identified its most vulnerable residents for outreach. But what works in one city might not be as effective in another. That's because each has its own unique architecture, transportation, layout and inequities, said Bharat Venkat, an associate professor at UCLA who directs the university's Heat Lab, aimed at tackling what he calls \"thermal inequality.\" Venkat thinks cities should address inequality by investing in labor rights, sustainable development and more. That may sound expensive - who pays, for instance, when a city tries to improve conditions for workers in blistering food trucks? - but Venkat thinks doing nothing will ultimately cost more. \"The status quo is actually deeply expensive,\" he said. \"We just don't do the math.\" France launched a heat watch warning system after an extended heat wave in 2003 was estimated to have caused 15,000 deaths - many of them older people in city apartments and homes without air conditioning. The system includes public announcements urging people to hydrate. Just last month, Germany launched a new that it said was inspired by France's experience. In India, a powerful heat wave in 2010 with temperatures over 118 degrees Fahrenheit (48 degrees Celsius) led to the deaths of over 1,300 people in the city of Ahmedabad. City officials now have a heat action plan to improve awareness in the local population and health care staff. Another simple initiative: Painting roofs white to reflect the blazing sun. Ladd Keith, an assistant professor at the University of Arizona, cited Baltimore's Code Red Extreme Heat alerts as an example of a well-designed alert system. The alerts go out when the forecast calls for a heat index of 105 Fahrenheit or higher, and sets in motion things like more social services in communities most vulnerable to heat risks. He lauded the heat officers in cities like Los Angeles, Miami and Phoenix, but said there are \"still over 19,000 cities and towns without them.\" Inkyu Han, an environmental health scientist at Temple University in Philadelphia, noted that cities are still struggling to get aids such as cooling centers and subsidized air conditioning into poorer neighborhoods. He said more can be done, too, with simple and sustainable solutions such as improving tree canopy. \"Notably, low-income neighborhoods and communities of color in Philadelphia often lack street trees and green spaces,\" Han said. In Providence, Rhode Island, the Atlantic Ocean typically moderates temperatures but the region can still get heat waves. Kate Moretti, an emergency room physician, said the city's hospitals see more patients when the heat strikes - with increases in illnesses that may not be obviously related to heat, like heart attacks, kidney failure and mental health problems. \"We definitely notice that it puts a strain on the system,\" Moretti said. Older people, , people with disabilities and people who are homeless make up a big share of those admissions, she said. Miami - considered a ground zero for the climate change threat due to its vulnerability to sea level rise, flooding, hurricanes and extreme heat - appointed its heat officer two years ago to develop strategies to keep people safe from the heat. Robin Bachin, an associate professor of civic and community engagement at the University of Miami, noted that the federal government has laws to protect people in cold climates from having their heat shut off in dangerous conditions, but doesn't have something similar for cooling. \"For people in apartments that are not publicly subsidized, there is no requirement for landlords to provide air conditioning,\" Bachin said. \"That's incredibly dangerous to particularly our local low-income population, let alone people who are unhoused or are outdoor workers.\" Klinenberg said that the United States has so far gotten lucky with the duration of most heat waves, but that electrical grids vulnerable to high demand in some regions, along with persistent social inequities, could spell serious trouble in the coming decades. That's partly because the underlying social problems that make heat events so deadly are only getting worse, Klinenberg said. Chicago's 1995 deaths were clustered not only in poor and segregated neighborhoods, but also specifically within what he calls \"depleted\" neighborhoods, places where it's harder for people to gather together and where social connections have been worn thin. Empty lots, abandoned restaurants and poorly maintained parks mean that people are less likely to check up on each other. Noboru Nakamura, a professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Chicago who specializes in extreme weather events, said he thinks Chicago has made plenty of smart changes by implementing heat emergency plans, routine wellness checks and cooling centers. But he too cited inequality as a difficult challenge. \"A systemic problem of a resource inequity is something that you can't really get rid of overnight. And we still have the same issue that we had back then today,\" Nakamura said. \"So that aspect still is a big, big, big, big unsolved problem.\"","pubDate":"2023-07-09 14:22:56","image_url":"https://thehimalayantimes.com/thehimalayantimes/uploads/images/2023/07/09/24684.jpg","source_id":"thehimalayantimes","category":["world"],"country":["Nepal"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Missing Mexican journalist’s body found","link":"https://kalingatv.com/world/missing-mexican-journalists-body-found/","keywords":["World","Journalist","journalist attacked"],"creator":["Subadh Nayak"],"video_url":null,"description":"Mexico: Body of Mexican journalist Luis Martin Sanchez Iniguez, 59, who was missing since Wednesday, has been recovered from the western state of Nayarit.

During a five-day trip to three countries, Biden plans to hail NATO's recent admission of Finland, but he must navigate thorny divisions over whether to expand the alliance further. Two increasingly divisive issues are expected to dominate the Summit in Lithuania, where Biden will travel between stops in London and Helsinki: Ukraine's desire to join the alliance and Sweden's stalled bid to do the same. Biden's ability to keep NATO unified in responding to Russia's aggression has become a key component of his reelection pitch. But with Turkey blocking Sweden from joining, a Ukrainian counteroffensive lagging, and fresh tensions over Biden's decision to give Ukraine cluster munitions, his meetings in Europe could become visibly contentious. Especially fraught is Ukraine's push to join NATO. Some allies - including summit host Lithuania - welcome the idea, while countries like the United States and Germany warn it would instantly escalate the confrontation with Russia, potentially to a nuclear level. Biden \"has been clear that we are going to support Ukraine for as long as it takes and provide them an exceptional quantity of arms and capabilities - both from ourselves and facilitating those from allies and partners - but that we are not seeking to start World War III,\" Jake Sullivan, Biden's national security adviser, said Friday. \"That is the course that we've been on since the start of this conflict.\" Ramping up the pressure, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in an interview broadcast on CNN on Wednesday evening, called on Biden to invite Ukraine into the organization \"now.\" Biden has been publicly noncommittal, telling reporters recently that the United States would not \"make it easy\" for Ukraine to join the group. NATO has historically rejected countries that are in the midst of an active invasion or occupation, because it would instantly embroil the alliance in hostilities, given its principle that an attack on one is an attack on all. NATO also seeks to ensure that its members uphold democracy and free markets. Sullivan told reporters that Ukraine needs to make \"additional reforms\" to become NATO-eligible. But with U.S. officials publicly vague on what exactly it would take for Ukraine to join, and given Biden's history of initially denying Zelenskyy's requests before ultimately relenting, his words and actions will be tracked closely during his trip for any sign that his position may be softening. For now, administration officials are scrambling to assemble a package of \"security guarantees\" that NATO could formally offer Ukraine during the summit. These commitments would fall short of a path to membership but signal a commitment to stand by the beleaguered country. Experts and observers said this compromise would probably imply the need for an end to the war with Russia before Ukraine can join the alliance. \"There are no real expectations in Ukraine that we will join NATO while there is war in Ukraine,\" said Yevgeniya Gaber, an expert on the country at the Atlantic Council. \"There is no real expectation that we will get this invitation in Vilnius.\" Biden will also need to factor in the domestic political landscape. Many of his Republican rivals, including former president Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, have expressed concern about open-ended U.S. support for Ukraine, and even some Democrats worry that the public will grow weary of America's investment in the war. \"President Zelenskyy is under the view that whatever he pushes for hard enough and long enough he'll get, because that's been the case with virtually everything we've seen to date,\" said Michael O'Hanlon, director of research in foreign policy at the Brookings Institution. \"I'm afraid he may be wrong on this question, because not only Joe Biden, but Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis, all seem skeptical of the idea of Ukraine being in NATO.\" Biden kicks off his trip with a brief stop Monday in London, where he will meet with British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and have his first face-to-face meeting with King Charles III since his coronation. He will then attend the NATO summit in Vilnius, Lithuania, on Tuesday, holding meetings with his counterparts before delivering what White House aides describe as a \"significant\" speech about his global vision on Wednesday. Biden will then travel to Helsinki to mark Finland's accession to NATO and meet with Nordic leaders. White House officials hope the trip will send a message to Russian President Vladimir Putin that NATO remains committed to supporting Ukraine for the long term. The stop in Finland could draw comparisons to Trump's 2018 visit to Helsinki, when he sided with Putin against U.S. intelligence officials during a news conference. While Trump relished disrupting global alliances like NATO, Biden has sought to reassure domestic and global audiences that he is a steady hand capable of reasserting American leadership on the world stage. The war in Ukraine has become the most significant test of Biden's ability to deliver on that proposition, and next week's NATO summit will be the latest in a series of global gatherings where the conflict has dominated the agenda. But as the war has dragged on - costing billions of dollars and slamming the global economy - it has become increasingly difficult for world leaders to find consensus. One potential collision at the summit was averted when NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg recently agreed to extend his term by a year, avoiding a potentially bruising fight to succeed him. Biden is still fighting a last-ditch effort to salvage Sweden's accession, which has been blocked for many months, primarily over objections from Turkey and its ally Hungary. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan complained that Sweden is too accommodating toward the militant Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, which has waged a long insurgency in Turkey and is considered a terrorist group by the United States and the European Union. There is little chance Turkey and Hungary will ratify Swedish accession before the summit, diplomats said, though some expressed hope that Biden and other allies could at least persuade Erdogan to agree to a deal that would allow the process to move forward. Stoltenberg has said he will convene a meeting of Swedish and Turkish leaders Monday. Sullivan said Biden would meet with Erdogan in Vilnius and that it was \"possible\" a deal on Sweden would emerge from the summit. \"It's a question of time,\" he said. \"And I can't predict whether that will happen next week or at some point in the ensuing weeks.\" Equally fraught is the question of whether the NATO allies will spend more on defense. After Russia's invasion, the alliance began what it called its biggest overhaul since the Cold War, reinforcing its eastern flank and rethinking its approach to deterrence and defense. Leaders will formally approve an ambitious set of defense plans in Vilnius, but it will require major investments for them to become reality. NATO for years has expected its members to spend at least 2 percent of their GDP on defense, but even with many allies boosting their spending in the face of Moscow's aggression, several remain far from the target. Stoltenberg said he expects allies to agree to make spending 2 percent of GDP \"a floor,\" or minimum, but it is unclear how, or even if, that will be enforced. Camille Grand, who until last year was NATO's assistant secretary general for defense investment and is now a distinguished policy fellow with the European Council on Foreign Relations, said a big hike in defense spending is necessary if the group hopes to meet the moment. \"If there is no sustained commitment to stay at 2 percent or above, the plans will be hard to implement,\" Grand said. But few issues are likely to be as contentious at the summit as the question of Ukraine's membership. NATO allies have all but ruled out immediate membership for Kyiv on account of the war, but the allies remain split on what should happen next. Some NATO members, particularly those in Eastern Europe, have pushed for a clear path or timeline for Ukraine to join the group. The Biden administration has shown some support for plans to remove barriers to Ukraine's entry, but has strongly resisted the idea of a specific timeline. While Poland and Italy have called for concrete security guarantees, and French President Emmanuel Macron has said there should be a clear \"path\" for Ukraine's NATO membership, Germany and the United States have been perceived as more reluctant. Several countries are now hashing out interim options to provide security guarantees and other long-term assurances to Kyiv that fall short of full membership. With Zelenskyy scheduled to attend the summit, diplomats are scrambling to find language that signals strong support while keeping the prospects for membership vague. Britain, France, Germany and the United States have been leading the initiative on a document aimed at assuring Ukraine that an invasion like the current one would not be allowed to happen again, according to two Western diplomats who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. \"It is something that is not a transition toward NATO, it's just a simple security guarantee,\" one of the diplomats said. That approach is unlikely to please Zelenskyy, whose aspirations are likely to be left \"unfulfilled,\" retired U.S. Army Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, a former commander of U.S. Army Europe, said. \"It is clear that the United States is not pushing for membership,\" Hodges said. \"They are either slow-rolling it or not exerting the energy to get everyone on board.\" Sullivan said Biden would be happy to meet with Zelenskyy during the summit, where he said \"important practical announcements\" would be made about Ukraine's relationship with NATO. Among other actions, leaders in Vilnius are expected to upgrade the authority of a joint NATO-Ukraine body that oversees the relationship. Biden, meanwhile, has sought to step up U.S. support for Ukraine in other ways in recent days, including by approving the provision of cluster munitions, weapons that are banned by most countries in the world, including several NATO members. With Ukraine's military running low on conventional artillery, Biden hoped to underline his commitment that the U.S. and the broader Western world would stand by Ukraine \"as long as it takes.\" Amid the lack of consensus within the alliance, many of Biden's counterparts will be looking to him to hash out a formal declaration at the summit that will showcase a united front and continued resolve. \"How do you find a form of words that will work in D.C., Berlin, London, Paris and beyond?\" a Western diplomat said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive issues. \"But it's not about the words - it will be about the substance that underpins it.\"","pubDate":"2023-07-09 14:00:00","image_url":"https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postguam.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/c6/7c67e7c8-1de5-11ee-8220-e3cf6e3314db/64a9f192352d8.image.jpg?resize=300%2C202","source_id":"postguam","category":["world"],"country":["united states of america"],"language":"english"},{"title":"No, private space colonies will not be dystopian hellscapes","link":"https://thehill.com/opinion/technology/4085526-no-private-space-colonies-will-not-be-dystopian-hellscapes/","keywords":["Technology","Opinion"],"creator":["Mark R.

SpaceX’s Elon Musk wants to build a city of on Mars. Jeff Bezos wants to build , first Gerard K. O’Neill, that can sustain even more people. Space colonies are the stuff of science fiction dreams, invoking the settlement of the American West. Not so fast, . Space colonies founded by private businesses are likely, in the story’s view, to be dystopian hells. The theory is that space colonists will be subject to the whims of their tech overlords. Free from the restraints of earthly laws, the founders of the first communities of humans beyond the home planet will do with their subjects as they like. The story cites accusations of racial discrimination and sexual harassment at tech companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin to buttress his case. It even invokes Werner Von Braun in his brief against private space colonies. Von Braun, before he moved to America and became a in the Jim Crow South, , even joining the Nazi Party and taking rank in the SS, though no evidence exists that he agreed with Nazi racial ideology. It seems to imply that space colonies could resemble the concentration camp, where people were literally worked to death to build V-2 rockets. The story seems also to have problems with what it called “American superiority in space” and resource extraction on the moon. It mischaracterizes the former, since the , started by NASA, stipulate a regime of cooperation on the space frontier and not the dominance of any one nation. Why there’s disdain for mining the moon or other celestial bodies is left as an exercise for the reader. The story’s thesis encounters one problem. If Musk’s Mars colony or Bezos’s free-flying space cities become latter-day East Berlins, who would want to move there? Space colonies are going to need the best and the brightest to become their citizens in order to survive and thrive. No one is going to sign up willingly to become denizens of outer space gulags. Real-world experience on Earth proves the point. The United States is not a perfect country by any means. Yet millions of people, either legally or otherwise, aspire to move to that country to enjoy its freedom and economic opportunities. Neither Russia nor China can make the same boast. Elon Musk has opened his mind about how he envisions his Mars city being governed. Far from being a company town ruled as a dictatorship, , much like an Ancient Greek polis, in which everyone decides government policy. He believes that representative democracy gives too much power to “special interests.” Still, some set of principles for how a space colony should be governed could be laid out in advance so that people who decide to leave Earth forever to make new lives in space could be assured of what they are getting into. Something similar to the Bill of Rights in the United States Constitution should be drawn up and agreed to. Anyone proposing to establish a space colony should promise to adopt a Space Colonist Bill of Rights stipulating what the government of a space colony can and cannot do with its citizens. Nations of the world could sign an agreement, much like the Artemis Accords, that promises to defend and enforce such a Bill of Rights. People in the future who contemplate moving off of the planet should be aware that they will not be settling down in a utopia. Elon Musk has assured one and all that the first settlers on Mars will . While a Mars colony is unlikely to become the dystopian hell that Scientific American warns about, human freedom, as is always the case, will have to be balanced by the need for survival. Still, people in the mid to late 21st century will have an opportunity that none have been offered since the closing of the American frontier in the late 19th century.

(AP) — A Vermont burglary suspect who led police on a high-speed chase and crashed his truck into two police cruisers, killing a 19-year-old officer and injuring two others, will be arraigned Monday on charges related to the crash, state police said. Tate Rheaume, 20, is facing charges of grossly negligent operation and attempting to elude, both with death resulting. Additional charges are possible, state police said. It was not immediately known if he is being represented by an attorney. Rutland City Police Officer Jessica Ebbighausen was killed on Friday afternoon. The crash happened as police chased a vehicle driven by Rheaume, a suspect in an attempted break-in at a house, state police said. Evidence indicates that Rheaume crossed the center line and collided head-on with the Ebbighausen’s cruiser, police said. The suspect’s truck also hit another police cruiser. Ebbighausen and another officer riding in the passenger’s seat were not wearing seat belts, state police said. Ebbighausen was pronounced dead at the scene. The two other officers and Rheaume were taken to Rutland Regional Medical Center with injuries, police said. Rheaume was transferred to the University of Vermont Medical Center in Burlington, where he was listed in serious but stable condition on Saturday afternoon, police said. One officer was released from the Rutland hospital on Friday, and the other was released Saturday. After an autopsy was completed on Saturday, nearly three dozen law-enforcement officers and first responders escorted Ebbighausen’s body in a procession from the medical examiner’s office in Burlington back to Rutland, state police said. Ebbighausen was a part-time Rutland City officer since May and was scheduled for training in August to become a full-time officer, police said.

These weapons would be a game changer,” McCaul said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” The administration on Friday announced plans to provide Ukraine with the long-requested weapons. Cluster munition are designed to spread out multiple submunitions over a wide area, and are banned by more than 100 countries due to the risks the explosives pose to civilians. Biden has the decision, saying the Ukrainians “needed them.” “I’m really pleased the administration has finally agreed to do this,” said McCaul who has been critical of the pace of aid sent to Ukraine by the Biden administration. McCaul noted that neither the U.S. nor Ukraine are a signatory to the Geneva Convention on cluster munitions, and that Russia is dropping cluster bombs in Ukraine “with impunity.” “All the Ukrainians and Zelensky are asking for is to give them the same weapons the Russians have to use in their own country, against Russians who are in their own country.

Cases of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) were first seen in Iraq and Namibia. There have now been cases in Spain as well as deaths recorded in Pakistan. And an urgent health warning has already been issued in what has been described as the current biggest threat to public health and is feared to be accelerated by climate change. The virus - which causes high fever and joint pain - is spread through ticks. The illness is caused by Nairovirus and according to the World Health Organization (WHO), it has a fatality rate of between 10 and 40 percent, the Mirror reports. READ MORE: The 'secret' button inside your car that can save money on fuel Last week, insiders speaking to Parliament's Science, Innovation and Technology Committee revealed it was \"highly likely\" there could soon be cases in the UK. During the hearing, James Wood, head of veterinary medicine at Cambridge University, said CCHF could find its way to the UK \"through our ticks, at some point\". The disease is feared to be expanding out of its usual territories and moving towards the likes of Britain and France because of climate change. Scroll down to read all we know about the virus. What are the symptoms of CCHF? Among the virus' symptoms include headaches , high fever, back and joint pain, stomach ache, and vomiting. Red eyes, a flushed face, a red throat, and petechiae (red spots) on the palate are also common. In severe cases, WHO warns that jaundice, mood swings and sensory perception are experienced. As the illness progresses, large areas of severe bruising, severe nosebleeds, and uncontrolled bleeding at injection sites can be seen, beginning on about the fourth day of illness and lasting for about two weeks. In documented outbreaks of CCHF, fatality rates in hospitalised patients ranged from nine percent to as high as 50 percent. The long-term effects of CCHF infection have not been studied well enough in survivors to determine whether or not specific complications exist. However, recovery is slow. How is it spread? According to the WHO, human-to-human transmission can occur resulting from “close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected persons”. Concerningly, there is currently no vaccine available for either people or animals infected by the disease. CCHF is transmitted to people by either bites from ticks or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues immediately after slaughter. Hosts of CCHF include a wide range of wild and domestic animals such as cattle, sheep and goats. According to the WHO, the majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers and veterinarians. How many reported deaths has there been? Iraq was reportedly in a major battle with the disease last year, with 212 incidents recorded between January 1 and May 22. Of those, 169 were reported between April and May alone. Agence France-Presse added in May that almost 100 additional cases - and 13 deaths - were so far in 2023 attributed to the toll in Iraq.","pubDate":"2023-07-09 13:53:37","image_url":"https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/article27287140.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_JS302812961.jpg","source_id":"birminghammail","category":["world"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Teen 'embarrassed' after doorman refuses to let her into McDonald's for not having ID","link":"https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/uk-news/teen-embarrassed-after-doorman-refuses-27287139","keywords":["News"],"creator":["newsdesk@walesonline.co.uk (Sam Volpe, Howard Lloyd)"],"video_url":null,"description":"Holly Munoz and her friend are both 18 but were still not allowed in by 'aggressive' security guards","content":"A teenager and her friend were 'embarrassed and upset' after being turned away from McDonald's doorstaff for not having ID - despite both women being 18 years old.

Tory peer Lord Deben, who has stepped down as chairman of the Climate Change Committee (CCC), has warned that both his Conservative colleagues in Westminster and Keir Starmer’s ambition o become the next government, are not taking the climate crisis seriously enough. Lord Deben was asked on Times Radio , whether he was “surprised” by the lack of enthusiasm for the climate crisis by both major parties at Westminster, giving the scale of the challenge to tackle it. Read more: Climate advisers: UK has 'undermined' COP26 progress with oil push In response, Lord Deben said: “Well, I don't think I'm surprised, I'm just extremely disappointed and increasingly concerned because it seems to me that it is the priority. “There is nothing more important than securing the world for our children. “And indeed, I may be quite old now, but it's securing it for me, because this is changing so fast that we are going to make the world an impossible place for us to live in the way in which we have lived up to now.” Lord Deben stressed that “we have to act very quickly”, but insisted “it can be done”. He added: “It's still within our reach as the Climate Change Committee said to the Prime Minister, you can get back on course if you move now and don't wait for the next election.” Lord Deben said the Prime Minister has “recommitted himself to the money that is going to the developing countries” so they “can go straight to renewables”. Read more: Rishi Sunak reportedly set to drop £11.6bn climate and nature pledge He added: “The last thing we want is for them to go through the oil and gas period. “That is a very major recommitment. But there's a lot more to do.” Reports had suggested that Rishi Sunak was ready to drop a £11.6bn pledged to help developing nations tackle the climate crisis. Lord Deben also issued a warning to his Conservative colleagues at Westminster concerned about immigration that a failure to tackle the climate crisis will simply exacerbate the issue. Estimates suggest that as many as 1.2 billion people could be displaced globally by 2050 due to the climate crisis and natural disasters. Lord Deben said: “I would say to those people who are most concerned about migration, you have not seen anything yet. “When these countries are too hot to live in, people will move not to better their lives, but to have a life of their own. “So unless we act very urgently, we're going to have a world which is absolutely destroyed by climate change.” Read more: What Scotland can learn from Dutch North Sea innovators The warning came as Labour shadow chancellor criticised tactics used by climate campaigners, insisting she has “got no time” for Just Stop Oil. She added that the tactics of disputing sporting events was “a bit pathetic and quite tedious”. She added: “If they want to tackle climate change, engage in the policy answers, but they are not building support for their cause, they are doing the exact opposite. “So it is counter-productive and it is rude frankly. “People paid to go to Wimbledon, it may be the one time in their life that they get to Wimbledon, they don’t want to be disrupted by a load of protesters.”","pubDate":"2023-07-09 13:45:05","image_url":"https://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/16979770/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"heraldscotland","category":["environment"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Mobile speed camera locations for Grimsby and Scunthorpe areas - July 9-15","link":"https://www.grimsbytelegraph.co.uk/news/motoring/mobile-speed-camera-locations-grimsby-8586575","keywords":["News"],"creator":["newsdesk@grimsbytelegraph.co.uk (Paul Johnson)"],"video_url":null,"description":"Safer Roads Humber and Humberside Police enforce mobile speed cameras around the region","content":"A popular route into Cleethorpes will be visited by mobile speed cameras in the coming week.

Doing so will help to help those inside the vehicle more comfortable - especially amid the recent hot weather. Drivers will likely not be surprised that their air-conditioning system uses engine power in diesel and petrol cars, or battery power in electric vehicles. For internal combustion engines that can lead to much bigger fuel consumption. The system usually works by taking the outside air and then heating or cooling it. However, drivers have now been told that this method uses much more fuel compared to the option which lets the car’s air-con system use the air from inside the car, the Liverpool Echo reports. READ MORE: Helen Skelton fans make same holiday observation and say 'you're not on Strictly now' Thankfully, there is a button specially designed to let motorists choose which option they prefer. If activated, the air recirculation button allows the aircon to use the air from inside the car by drawing it through vents. At the same time, it stops the outside air from getting in. The button is usually located around the aircon dial that allows the driver to set the internal temperature. It has a picture of a car with an arrow inside it. Using the button will help reduce fuel consumption as it puts less strain on the car's engine. The principle is the same for electric cars as the aircon will put less strain on the battery. \"The compressor requires energy to run your vehicle’s air conditioning system and so will use a small amount of fuel whenever the system is running,\" Bradley Jando from Kwik Fit said. He added: \"It could increase your fuel usage by as much as 10 percent, and the effects are particularly noticeable on short journeys. When you initially set off, the air con has to work hard to bring the internal temperature down to a comfortable level.\"","pubDate":"2023-07-09 13:41:43","image_url":"https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/article27287084.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_JS270113900.jpg","source_id":"birminghammail","category":["world"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Zimbabwean musician Platinum Prince NABBED for hijacking in South Africa","link":"https://nehandaradio.com/2023/07/09/zimbabwean-musician-platinum-prince-nabbed-for-hijacking-in-south-africa/","keywords":["Crimes & Courts","Diaspora","Featured","Music","News","Showbiz","Ian Makiwa","Platinum Prince","platinum prince arrested"],"creator":["Zim Morning Post"],"video_url":null,"description":"In a shocking turn of events, a famous ZimDancehall artist, Platinum Prince, was caught trying to hijack a diesel tanker in South Africa on Thursday night.

The statement continued: “The strike on Friday was conducted by the same MQ-9s that had, earlier in the day, been harassed by Russian aircraft in an encounter that had lasted almost two hours.” Centcom added that the strike is believed to have been carried out with no collateral harm to civilians, though the coalition in the region is currently assessing any reports made about civilian harm or death caused by the incident. “We have made it clear that we remain committed to the defeat of ISIS throughout the region,” General Michael “Erik” Kurilla, commander of Centcom, said. “ISIS remains a threat, not only to the region but well beyond.” Little information is currently available about Al-Muhajir and what his actions were in Syria.

Pita Limjaroenrat's pro-democracy Move Forward Party (MFP) netted the most seats at the May 14 election but there are no guarantees it will be able to form government or that he will become the premier. MFP's eight-party coalition has a total of 312 lower house seats but remains short of the 376 votes needed across both houses of parliament to endorse Pita for the top job.

Meanwhile, outside parliament, he is being investigated over claims he was ineligible to run for office since he allegedly owned shares in a now-defunct media company. Legislators are not allowed to own media shares. Pita said the kingdom faces a momentous day this week when both the upper and lower houses will vote. \"If you do not step back, I won't,\" he told hundreds of supporters gathered in the rain in central Bangkok. \"If we make the right decision and give Thailand a chance, our country will develop,\" he told the crowd.

Recent reporting by OpenSecrets uncovered that the George Jenkins Foundation, where Fancelli sits as board president and was the sole funder in 2021, gave millions more to groups involved in the January 5 and 6 rallies than previously known, including a staggering $1.375 million to a far right group called Moms for America. Moms for America has received significantly less media attention than other right-wing “women’s” groups — such as Moms for Liberty, Women for America First, the Independent Women’s Forum/Voice, and Concerned Women for America — that are funded by ultra-wealthy donors whose identities they keep secret from the public. But Moms for America has also been a major player in pushing voter suppression, election denialism, attacks on public schools and COVID-19 misinformation . Moms for America, which was created in 2005 as “Homemakers for America” and recently designated by the Southern Poverty Law Center as an anti-government extremist group , deserves greater scrutiny for its role in January 6 and other efforts to undermine democracy. Its funders warrant greater scrutiny too. Moms for America and its staffers helped organize the January 5 “Stop the Steal” rally the day before the far right attack at the U.S. Capitol. Founder and President Kimberly Fletcher, who spoke at the January 5 rally, was subsequently subpoenaed by the House January 6 committee. During her deposition , Fletcher pled the Fifth Amendment to nearly every question posed to her, but the committee referenced exhibits demonstrating the high level of involvement Moms for America and its representatives played in organizing the event. These exhibits show that beginning in December 2020, Fletcher was part of a text thread with fellow rally organizers Ali Alexander, Nathan Martin and Ed Martin in which she told them she had secured permits for activities to answer then-President Donald Trump’s call to prevent the election from being certified. They also demonstrate that Moms for America Vice President Debbie Kraulidis helped coordinate accommodations for the January 5 “Stop the Steal” event attendees, and Moms for America provided a VIP list for the January 6 event at the White House Ellipse, where Trump spoke and urged the crowd to go to the Capitol and “fight like hell.” Cindy Chafian helped organize and spoke at the “Stop the Steal” rally on January 5, while her husband Scott Chafian acted as head of security, according to January 6 committee testimony . Moms for America soon thereafter hired Cindy Chafian as its “ director of coalitions and engagement. ” In her speech, Chafian addressed her comments directly to Trump: “We heard your call, and we are here for you, Mr. President.” She specifically thanked armed militias — the Oath Keepers, Three Percenters, First Amendment Praetorian (which her husband reportedly leads ) and the Proud Boys — for “defending” the crowd. She also disputed that the Proud Boys are white supremacists and led a chant in support of Proud Boy founder Enrique Tarrio, who was recently found guilty of seditious conspiracy for plotting to attack the Capitol on January 6. Video footage allegedly shows her marching up the stairs of the Capitol on January 6 and cheering as rioters assaulted a police officer. Moms for America board of directors member Charles W. Herbster, a former Trump adviser who has been accused of sexual assault by eight women , posted on Facebook the afternoon before the insurrection that he was “in the private residence of the President at Trump International with the following patriots who are joining me in a battle for justice and truth.” According to Herbster’s post , those in attendance were Sen. Tommy Tuberville (who denied being there despite photos of him in the hotel lobby that day), former Republican Attorneys General Association Executive Director Adam Piper, Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, former Trump National Security Adviser Michael Flynn (who Trump pardoned after he was convicted of a felony for lying to the FBI), Trump adviser Peter Navarro, Trump 2016 campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and deputy campaign manager David Bossie, who also led the conservative group Citizens United. The activities leading up to January 6 were not the only efforts Moms for America made to undermine the public’s faith in the legitimacy of U.S. elections. The group joined up with the “Stop the Steal” coalition to organize and participated in rallies promoting the Big Lie (that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump) and pushing for recounts in all 50 states, according to Moms for America’s 2020 “Year in Review” report . Mercedes Schlapp, who serves on Moms for America’s board of directors and previously worked for Trump’s 2020 campaign, created a legal fund to cover the defense of numerous individuals subpoenaed by the House January 6 committee. She is married to Matt Schlapp , chairman of the Conservative Political Action Conference . Additionally, Sherronna Bishop, whom Moms for America describes as an “Election Security Specialist,” has proposed getting rid of voting machines, automatic voter registration and most absentee voting . She was deeply involved in a scheme by former Colorado elections clerk Tina Peters to discredit the results of the 2020 presidential election in the state, which resulted in Bishop’s home being searched by the Federal Bureau of Investigation . Bishop was not charged as part of the investigation. Bishop also has had a close relationship to MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, who produced a documentary about the incident in which Bishop co-starred . Bishop flew on Lindell’s private plane to Lindell’s 2021 Moment of Truth Conference in August 2022, where she went on her own conspiratorial rant about the “2020 fraud election” and other claims that have repeatedly been debunked. Fancelli’s 2021 contribution to Moms for America amounted to more than a third of the group’s funding that year, but it also received donations from other far right groups tied to January 6 and the Big Lie. In fact, Moms for America saw a massive influx of cash in 2021, taking in $3.1 million in contributions, a dramatic increase from just $408,000 in 2020. Moms for America’s second-largest known donor in 2021, the Bradley Impact Fund (BIF), a pass-through group that disguises the identities of its donors, contributed $752,500. BIF is legally separate but closely tied to the Bradley Foundation , a massive right-wing foundation that journalist Jane Mayer exposed for its role in pushing the Big Lie . Some of the Bradley foundation’s previously secret funders include Barre Seid, Richard Uihlein and Paul Singer — all recently in the news for their ties to right-wing activist Leonard Leo’s court capture network. BIF also gave more than $7 million that year to Charlie Kirk’s Turning Point USA, a right-wing group that helped transport Big Lie enthusiasts to the January 6 rallies, and received (together with its action arm) at least $1 million from Fancelli for January 6 organizing and legal efforts. Moms for America also took in $10,000 from America’s Future Inc., a dark money group chaired by Michael Flynn , who called for Trump to declare “martial law” and stop the certification of the 2020 election. America’s Future gave nearly $1 million to the “Cyber Ninjas” that engaged in the faux and repeatedly discredited Arizona “audit.” Moms for America Action (MFA Action), the group’s 501(c)(4) arm, launched in 2020, but is now “pending inactive” in Virginia where it is registered on account of a past-due annual report and unpaid fees. MFA Action has so far not responded to efforts by True North Research to obtain its 2021 tax filings. This lack of transparency by a group actively involved in trying to influence election results is concerning given the significant amount of work the group has done to get out the vote among “conservative women of faith” ahead of the November 2020 election. It has a 15-state plan “to engage and mobilize moms to get out the mom vote” in 2024, as well as in other state and local elections, specifically school board elections, in 2023. Moms for America is also one of the dark money groups behind the recent manufactured outrage targeting public schools. The group launched MomForce, an initiative targeting education, in August 2021 and has hosted trainings for right-wing moms on how to disrupt their local school boards and run for office themselves. In 2022, Moms for America bragged about creating a legal fund designed specifically to “help moms” battle with what it claims are “increasingly radical and overreaching behavior” by schools. The real radical overreach is by groups like Moms for America who attack the honest teaching of history and measures to treat students with respect for who they are. Attacks on schools are not unrelated to right-wing efforts to influence elections. Some in the media have credited the coordinated assault on Virginia public schools as the key to Glenn Youngkin’s upset victory in the 2020 Virginia gubernatorial election. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has made manufacturing outrage over schools — partnering with dark money agents from Moms for Liberty, the Manhattan Institute and the Leadership Institute — a centerpiece of his bid for the presidency. In fact, in the lead-up to the Florida election, Fancelli contributed $50,000 to a political action committee run by the anti-government organization Moms for Liberty, which donated to the campaigns of far right school board candidates in Florida, most of whom also received contributions from DeSantis’s PAC. Although MFA Action’s website does not list any endorsements for school board candidates in the Florida election, Moms for America claims to have had “big win[s]” including 43 school board seats in 13 Florida counties. In general, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit like Moms for America cannot expressly endorse an electoral candidate without risking its tax-exempt status. Moms for America seemingly has a significant presence in the state with local chapters in Polk County , Sarasota County , Palm Beach County and Brevard County, as well as a state liaison . Moms for America took credit for helping elect Governor Youngkin and taking over school board and city council seats in 17 states in 2021. MFA Action also endorsed candidates in Virginia in the state’s 2022 election. In 2023, it has officially backed dozens of school board and other local candidates’ elections in Virginia, South Carolina , Illinois and Texas . Moms for America’s staff and leadership also demonstrate the group’s focus on attacking public education. Rebecca Friedrichs, who is on Moms for America’s advisory council, was the lead plaintiff in a 2016 Supreme Court case against a California teachers union brought by a legal group funded by the right-wing Bradley Foundation. She later created a right-wing group dubbed “For Kids and Country,” which promotes a “union exit” for teachers and encourages parents to convince their children’s teachers to leave their unions. Sam Sorbo — who sits on Moms for America’s board of directors and is married to actor and right-wing provocateur Kevin Sorbo — created and runs an anti-public school group . Sorbo claimed on Newsmax that teachers “want to have sex with your children .” Right-wing public school privatization groups have increasingly relied on outrageous claims like this to ostensibly create public mistrust of school teachers and attack schools that treat LGBTQ+ children and adults with dignity. Moms for America also pushes extreme nationalism on children, with an entire section of its website dedicated to “restoring patriotism,” which includes jingoistic lesson plans and Zoom sessions pushing far right “values.” The group has produced “guides” for moms on how to oppose the truthful telling of history in schools and amplify the voices of right-wing parents , while silencing other parents. They also plan to create an anti-trans guide for parents. Like many anti-public school groups , Moms for America also has ties to right-wing religious fundamentalists. In 2019, the group attended a meeting of the secretive Council for National Policy, a Christian right group that has been described as a “a little-known club of a few hundred of the most powerful conservatives in the country .” Sam Sorbo has pushed for the teaching of religion in public schools and even claimed, without evidence, that if schools don’t teach the Bible, children will learn to hate it. She also claimed absurdly that it “is the best history book that we have.” Moms for America has also pushed against the separation of church and state in a blog post on supposed myths about the U.S. Constitution. Moms for America recently announced a partnership with Patriot Academy , a far right education group that claims to have trained more than 500,000 individuals in their religious fundamentalist dogma, for a series of Zoom meetings titled “Biblical Citizenship in Modern America,” a nonsensical title considering U.S. Constitution expressly bars any religious test or oath for holding office and explicitly bars Congress from establishing any religion as the state religion. Moms for America is a little-known group that is a relatively large cog in a well-resourced far right machine focused on assailing our democracy and core institutions, along with undermining rights most people in the U.S. hold dear. Despite its lack of name recognition nationally, the group has vast sums at its disposal. Moms for America and its donors should not be overlooked as it joins other dark money groups set on dominating local school boards and state elections in 2023 and 2024, as well as the upcoming 2024 presidential race.

Many Kenyans have been supportive of the decision but a few of Khaligraphs peers have differed. During her unveiling, the teen sensation told fans what to expect about their sound “I wasn’t sure how our styles would blend, but working with Khaligraph has been awesome. He is not only incredibly talented but also a sweetheart to work with. I couldn’t have asked for a better person to collaborate with on my first endeavor of this kind,” the ex-singer is quoted as promising her fans. Khali agreed as much; \"I want to express my gratitude to Coke Studio for giving me the opportunity to be a part of this song with Nikita. I’ve been a fan of her music. I come from Kayole, and she hails from Karen, so it’s an exciting blend, and I can’t wait for people to witness what we’ve created together,\" he said. Willy Paul and Scar Mkadinali appeared to have a dissenting voice and aired their opinion individually, bashing the selection. Khaligraph who is very vocal on things music, reacted to Willy Paul, in a hard-hitting note. And Sunday, July 9, Nikita appeared to dig in as well with her own sentiments. “Artists are not like Athletes. We cannot win gold, we cannot beat other creatives, and we cannot come in first.

The Palestinian Authority is cutting off with Israel. A significant Israeli operation to clear terrorist strongholds in the West Bank has just been completed. With the embers still burning in the Samarian Hills, the question is whether we are seeing the beginning of a Third Intifada. But there is another shoe yet to drop. The death of the ailing 87-year-old President , whenever it happens, will make things significantly worse. Abbas is an unpopular figure with his citizenry. Currently in the 18th year of his four-year term as president of the Palestinian Authority, he holds every major role in the Palestinian leadership, Fatah, the PLO and the security apparatus. His passing will create a huge vacuum and a window of opportunity for a rogues gallery of characters who have been waiting in the wings to pounce. This includes Iranian-sponsored terrorists such as and the , as well as supporters of convicted murderers such as and a myriad of corrupt PA officials just waiting for the opportunity to line their pockets. Unfortunately, the best and brightest of Palestinian society are not likely to accede to senior positions to lead their people to a better tomorrow. The Washington Institute’s “Sudden Succession Series, ,” asks how the U.S. might “adjust to the new situation.” There is no reason for America to be reactive and wait for Abbas’s passing. A Third Intifada is already brewing, there has been an uptick in in the West Bank, and rockets are being fired from the West Bank toward Israeli cities for the first time in nearly two decades. The PA has lost control of the cities of Jenin, Nablus and Tulkram to Iranian allies Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and Hamas. The remnants of PA security forces in those areas still compete to kill and maim as many IDF soldiers and Israeli civilians as possible. Everyone who commits violent acts is celebrated as a hero or martyr, knowing the PA will pay them and their families compensation for their actions, better known in the U.S. as “ Congress passed to stop payments to the PA until it stopped paying for and incentivizing terrorism. The Biden administration’s circumvention of the plain meaning of the to economically support the PA gets to the heart of the question of how America and Israel deal with the PA. Although Netanyahu doesn’t say it publicly, he wants the PA to be strengthened so that it can work with Israel on security coordination and not let anarchy reign in the West Bank. For America, this is not about resolving the conflict but rather about lowering the flames before things get even more out of control. Israel may need to execute a more significant operation soon, similar to , which quelled the in 2002. It will cause a conflagration spilling over to Gaza and perhaps igniting Hezbollah and Iranian-controlled militias in Syria. The world will be outraged and call for Israel to be sanctioned. The Biden administration is no fan of Israel’s current coalition. They interpret Israel’s expansion of in response to Palestinian violence, and Israel’s lax prosecution of vigilante violence against Palestinian villages as unnecessary provocations, as inflaming a volatile situation that could spin out of control. Jerusalem Post writer Herb Keinon believes Netanyahu cannot ignore the reality of the situation, or else he will end up in a confrontation with the Biden administration. “Netanyahu must lay out ” he writes. “Up until now, when security cooperation has worked with the PA, it worked because the Palestinians believed this would be the path to statehood. But if Netanyahu is blocking that path through word and action, then what incentive do they have for working with Israel?” The Biden administration, meanwhile, will have to make some tough choices. Sitting on the sidelines with milquetoast statements calling for peace will only inflame an already explosive situation. America’s most prominent pro-Israel organization, , recently wrote a letter to its supporters regarding the increasingly volatile situation in the West Bank. “America must unequivocally stand by our ally Israel as it defends itself from terrorism, pressure the PA to increase its security cooperation with the Jewish State, and demand Palestinian leaders stop their anti-Israel incitement,” it reads. But if Netanyahu wants Biden on his side, he must make concessions. Netanyahu now appears to be at his since he first became prime minister over 25 years ago. He has to show true leadership and prioritize Israel’s security situation. The current Israeli operation just bought some time, and Israel will likely need a that could last months. Therefore, he must offer Biden some face-saving gestures if he wants full American support. Netanyahu needs to be proactive and negotiate with Biden now. He will likely have to concede on settlement expansion for the time being and take charge of his rabble-rousers as a quid pro quo for steadfast U.S. support for a long-term operation and putting pressure on the PA to work more closely with Israeli security. For Netanyahu, getting half a loaf is better than getting none.","pubDate":"2023-07-09 13:30:00","image_url":"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/06/64881479d28661.83632695.jpeg?w=900","source_id":"thehill","category":["politics"],"country":["united states of america"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Manchester United's longest-serving players after David de Gea exit","link":"https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-team-news-latest-27286481","keywords":["Manchester United FC"],"creator":["newsdesk@men-news.co.uk (Richard Fay)"],"video_url":null,"description":"Man Utd could lose a number of experienced players this summer after David de Gea confirmed his exit.","content":"It is the end of an era for Manchester United following David de Gea's permanent departure. The Spaniard confirmed over the weekend that he would be leaving the club after his contract expired last month, bringing to an end his 12-year stay at Old Trafford. De Gea, 32, was the last remaining playing member of the Sir Alex Ferguson regime and the last player at the club who had won a Premier League title with United. It is a huge shame he left without the opportunity to be properly thanked for his service, and few fans would begrudge De Gea the opportunity to play a testimonial match in the future.

De Gea will be missed by his teammates, but his absence provides an opportunity for someone else to step in and establish themselves as leaders in the dressing room. His departure also means there is now a new longest-serving player at the club, one who remains integral to Ten Hag's plans heading into the next season. Luke Shaw will celebrate a decade at United next summer, having joined the club all the way back in 2014 as Louis van Gaal's second signing. The 27-year-old has been at the club longer than any other teammate and looks set to stay there for the foreseeable future after signing a new long-term contract back in April. It means he could have been at the club for 13 years by the time his deal expires in June 2027. Anthony Martial is the second longest-serving, having arrived in 2015, with Marcus Rashford the third-longest after making his breakthrough during the same campaign.

The Russian qualifier is the latest teen sensation in tennis, and she isn’t disappointing at the All England Club. Andreeva is the youngest player since Coco Gauff in 2019 to reach the women’s fourth round at Wimbledon. She reached the third round at this year’s French Open in her first major tournament. Despite trailing 4-1 in the second set, Andreeva beat 22nd-seeded Anastasia Potapova 6-2, 7-5 on No. 3 Court. “I came back from 1-4, so of course I feel great,” Andreeva said on court before explaining how she keeps her cool. “Today, honestly, even if I wanted to show some emotions, I honestly, I couldn’t because I was out of breath almost every point. I really couldn’t show any emotions.” They came out after, though, when Andreeva sat in her chair and pulled her purple Wimbledon towel up over her face for a few seconds to regain her composure. Andreeva will next face No. 25 Madison Keys for a spot in the quarterfinals. The third-round victory came 21 minutes after Marketa Vondrousova became the first player to reach the Wimbledon quarterfinals. Vondrousova defeated 32nd-seeded Marie Bouzkova 2-6, 6-4, 6-3. Fourth-seeded Jessica Pegula also reached the quarterfinals. The 29-year-old American beat Lesia Tsurenko 6-1, 6-3 and will next face Vondrousova.

Holly Munoz, 18, was with a friend the same age when the pair went to get some food at McDonald's in Cramlington, Northumberland. But the duo were turned away as they didn't have any identification. Holly and her friend had just been to the local Vue cinema before walking over the road to the eatery just after 4pm on Wednesday, July 5. When they got to the door, Holly says an \"aggressive\" member of door staff refused them entry and told them ID was necessary to go inside. The restaurant has a temporary policy restricting access to under-18s without a parent or guardian in place due to reported anti-social behaviour, ChronicleLive reports.

He said that staff there ignored his complaints and the same member of door staff was \"aggressive\" towards him too and denied having even spoken to his daughter. McDonald's have said it had introduced \"various measures\" in response to anti-social behaviour, but that customers being asked for ID would not happen again. A sign on the door of the fast food restaurant (Image: Iain Buist/Newcastle Chronicle) Speaking about the incident, Holly said: \"It's embarrassing when you are just going to get food and they don't let you in. We had just been to the cinema. We're quite independent, we do everything ourselves. \"And I just think when McDonald's says it's for everyone, this is bad for the brand. It was upsetting. To turn away people just because they are young.\" Her dad Julian added: \"I do understand that we have a huge problem with anti-social behaviour - as does much of the North East. But for some reason the security they have on the door is like if you were going out in Newcastle. \"My daughter went to the cinema and then following that she walked over he road to get some tea. She was confronted at the front door and asked for ID. Surely that's got nothing to do with security. I'd understand more if it was a big group of kids but it wasn't. \"They both work in the shopping centre, they're both students. They're going to university next year - but they can't go to McDonald's? It's astonishing.\" A McDonald’s spokesperson said: \"The safety and security of our people and our customers is our utmost priority, and our Cramlington restaurant has introduced various measures to help mitigate the challenges of anti-social behaviour affecting the wider area. \"These include employing security guards and making the decision to temporarily restrict restaurant access to under-18s who are unaccompanied after 4pm.

Wanyama posted a picture of the bae with a sweet caption, “I choose you, and I will choose you over and again. Happy 7th anniversary, love.” Teshna for her part wrote, “Love you to infinity, baby. Happy anniversary to us, love.” In a past interview mid-last year, the actress refused to clarify the nature of her relationship with Wanyama. “It's been six, seven years of enjoying ourselves. As to whether we are married or not that is something that will get to know with time. You know we are very private individuals and that’s how we keep it,” she said.

Former environment secretary George Eustice called on Rishi Sunak to negotiate bilateral deals with European countries offering work visas for young people. He hit out at the prime minister over labour shortages and the resulting inflationary pressures, claiming they were not caused by Brexit, but by “the failure of our post-Brexit immigration policy ”. And Mr Eustice challenged Mr Sunak over “flaws” in the current “so-called skills-based immigration system”, adding that the policy does not correspond to the needs of the economy. While he did not call for a return to freedom of movement between the UK and EU, Mr Eustice urged Mr Sunak to “rekindle that post-Brexit friendship with our European neighbours”. The former minister’s comments will be seen as an admission of the failings of the government’s post-Brexit immigration policy. They come amid growing unease among Conservative MPs about the failings of Brexit, and as senior Tory Tobias Ellwood has called for Britain to rejoin the single market. Mr Eustice told The Observer : “We are allowing in people who are deemed skilled such as lawyers, insolvency practitioners, museum officers, even disc jockeys, when we have no shortages whatsoever in those sectors. “But we are not allowing people to come here to work in sectors like the food industry, even though there are acute labour shortages in these sectors, and that is contributing to inflation. “So that is the big problem. My proposal is that we commence bilateral negotiations with EU member states, starting with countries like Bulgaria, Romania and the Baltic states, and widen it to the whole of the EU eventually, to establish a reciprocal youth-mobility visa scheme.” Mr Eustice said the agreements should see EU citizens under 35 allowed to live and work in the UK for two years, while UK citizens would be allowed to do the same in EU member states with which deals were struck. His intervention is the latest sign of a split within the Conservative Party on immigration, coming just days after a group of right-wing MPs launched the so-called New Conservatives. The group is calling for Mr Sunak to crack down on foreign social care workers and overseas students to bring net migration down from 606,000 to below 226,000 before the next election . The New Conservatives group was slapped down by No10 and branded “populist and isolationist” by fellow Tory MPs . Mr Eustice also attacked Theresa May’s post-Brexit immigration policy, calling it “a remainer’s interpretation of what Brexit was about”. “This idea of having no temporary visa schemes was not from the Vote Leave campaign,” he said. Mr Eustice added: “That was not what Brexit was about. People wanted controlled immigration and not to pull up the drawbridge and allow no one in at all.” Industries including hospitality, retail, construction and transport have been blighted by the loss of EU workers post-Brexit. The British Retail Consortium has blamed Brexit for “exacerbating Labour shortages” facing the sector. A home office spokesman said: “We already have successful Youth Mobility Schemes with 10 countries, including Australia and New Zealand, and remain open to agreeing them with our international partners, including EU member states. “We work closely with the Migration Advisory Committee to ensure our points-based system delivers for the UK and works in the best interests of the economy, including reviewing the Shortage Occupation List to ensure it reflects the current labour market.”","pubDate":"2023-07-09 13:23:48","image_url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2022/09/06/14/704553f8c4178f096274bd92c9cc840eY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjYyNTU2MzU5-2.65732059.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp","source_id":"independentuk","category":["politics"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Expert claims Prince harry is pretending to be happy in US","link":"https://www.skynews.com.au/opinion/expert-claims-prince-harry-is-pretending-to-be-happy-in-us/video/cbbd4b1de81ffb698f9e160f55639ea2","keywords":["Opinion","United Kingdom","fb","msn","opinion","uk","world","yt"],"creator":[""],"video_url":null,"description":"GT Communications Gemma Tognini says Prince harry “doesn’t know who he is” after the Royal was likened to an actor as an expert remarked he looked as though he was pretending to be happy in the US.","content":"GT Communications Gemma Tognini says Prince harry “doesn’t know who he is” after the Royal was likened to an actor as an expert remarked he looked as though he was pretending to be happy in the US.","pubDate":"2023-07-09 13:22:46","image_url":null,"source_id":"skynewsau","category":["world"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Solar storm to make Northern Lights visible in 17 US states","link":"https://thehill.com/homenews/4087477-solar-storm-to-make-northern-lights-visible-in-17-us-states/","keywords":["News","Energy & Environment","aurora borealis","Northern Lights","solar storm"],"creator":["Julia Mueller"],"video_url":null,"description":"A solar storm is expected to make the Northern Lights visible in 17 U.S. states on Thursday, forecasters say.

On Saturday (8 June), the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ruled in a 2-1 decision that the law can go into effect immediately. The panel of three judges voted to reverse the decision of a lower court, which prohibited the enforcement of the anti-trans law while it is undergoing legal challenges. The appeals court ruled that challenges to Tennessee’s Senate Bill 1 (SB1) were unlikely to succeed on claims that the ban is unconstitutional. SB1 denies all under-18s in the state the right to trans healthcare, such as physically-reversible puberty blockers. It also bans gender-affirming surgeries for minors, which is already not legal anywhere in the US – or in the many other countries worldwide, including the UK. The gender-affirming care ban was signed into law by governor Bill Lee on 2 March and would leave doctors who provide trans medical care to minors at risk of legal action from parents, guardians and the state attorney general. On 26 April, and alleging that a ban on providing medically necessary care to trans minors violates the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection clause. for the middle district of Tennessee described the legislation as violating “the constitutional rights of some of Tennessee’s most vulnerable citizens” and codifying “discrimination against children who already face far too many obstacles”. In Saturday’s appeals ruling, Judge Jeffrey Sutton wrote: “Life-tenured federal judges should be wary of removing a vexing and novel topic of medical debate from the ebbs and flows of democracy by construing a largely unamendable federal constitution to occupy the field. The ban was previously scheduled to go into effect on 1 July, and is part of – much of it targeting trans youth – currently sweeping the US. , 20 states have introduced laws banning trans youth from accessing gender-affirming care, while at least another seven are considering similar policies.

Ahn Young-joon/AP hide caption Protesters stage a rally against Japanese government's plan to release treated radioactive water from Fukushima nuclear power plant, at the National Assembly in Seoul, South Korea, on Sunday, July 9, 2023. SEOUL, South Korea — South Korean opposition lawmakers sharply criticized the head of the United Nations' nuclear watchdog on Sunday for its approval of Japanese plans to release treated wastewater from the damaged Fukushima nuclear power plant. They met with Rafael Grossi in a tense meeting in Seoul that took place while protesters screamed outside the door. Grossi, the International Atomic Energy Agency's director general, arrived in South Korea over the weekend to engage with government officials and critics and help reduce public concerns about food safety. The IAEA last week approved the Japanese discharge plans, saying the process would meet international safety standards and pose negligible environmental and health impacts. South Korea's government has also endorsed the safety of the Japanese plans. In his meeting with members of the liberal Democratic Party, which controls a majority in South Korea's parliament, Grossi said the IAEA's review of the Japanese plans was based on \"transparent\" and \"scientific\" research. He acknowledged concerns over how the Japanese plans would play out in reality and said the IAEA would establish a permanent office in Fukushima to closely monitor how the discharge process is implemented over the next three decades. \"Our conclusion has been that this plan, if it is carried out in the way it has been presented, would be in line, would be in conformity with the international safety standards,\" Grossi said. The lawmakers responded by harshly criticizing IAEA's review, which they say neglected long-term environmental and health impacts of the wastewater release and threatens to set a bad precedent that may encourage other countries to dispose nuclear waste into sea. They called for Japan to scrap the discharge plans and work with neighboring countries to find safer ways to handle the wastewater, including a possible pursuit of long-term storage on land. The party has also criticized the government of South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol for putting people's health at risk while trying to improve relations with Japan. \"If you think (the treated wastewater) is safe, I wonder whether you would be willing to suggest the Japanese government use that water for drinking or for industrial and agricultural purposes, rather than dumping it in the sea,\" Woo Won-shik, a Democratic Party lawmaker who attended the meeting, told Grossi. The party said Woo has been on a hunger strike for the past 14 days to protest the Japanese discharge plans. Further details from the meeting weren't immediately available after reporters were asked to leave following opening statements. Closely watched by parliamentary security staff, dozens of protesters shouted near the lobby of the National Assembly's main hall where the meeting was taking place, holding signs denouncing the IAEA and Japan. Grossi was to fly to New Zealand later on Sunday and would then travel to the Cook Islands as he further tries to reassure countries in the region about the Japanese plans. Hundreds of demonstrators had also marched in downtown Seoul on Saturday demanding that Japan scrap its plans. A massive earthquake and tsunami in 2011 destroyed the Fukushima plant's cooling systems, causing three reactors to melt and release large amounts of radiation. Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, which operates the facility, has been storing the treated water in hundreds of tanks that now cover most of the plant and are nearly full. Japanese officials say the tanks must be removed to make room to build facilities for the plant's decommissioning and to minimize the risk of leaks in case of another major disaster. The tanks are expected to reach their capacity of 1.37 million tons in early 2024. Japan first announced plans to discharge the treated water into the sea in 2018, saying the water will be further diluted by seawater before being released in a carefully controlled process that will take decades to complete. The safety of Fukushima's wastewater has been a sensitive issue for years between the U.S. allies. South Korea and Japan have been working in recent months to repair relations long strained over wartime historical grievances to address shared concerns such as the North Korean nuclear threat and China's assertive foreign policy. In a statement released by state media on Sunday, North Korea also criticized the Japanese discharge plans, warning against \"fatal adverse impact on the human lives and security and ecological environment.\" The statement, which was attributed to an unidentified official in North Korea's Ministry of Land and Environment Protection, also criticized Washington and Seoul for backing the Japanese plans. \"What matters is the unreasonable behavior of IAEA actively patronizing and facilitating Japan's projected discharge of nuclear-polluted water, which is unimaginable,\" it said. \"Worse still, the U.S. and (South) Korea openly express unseemly 'welcome' to Japan's discharge plan that deserves condemnation and rejection, provoking strong anger of the public.\"","pubDate":"2023-07-09 13:15:43","image_url":null,"source_id":"npr","category":["world"],"country":["united states of america"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Lithium Thionyl Chloride Battery Market Analysis Forecast 2023-2029 Global Industry Demand, Sales, Growth Rate, Key Application, Trends and By Region - United States, Europe, China, Japan, Southeast Asia, India","link":"https://www.openpr.com/news/3119695/lithium-thionyl-chloride-battery-market-analysis-forecast","keywords":["Energy & Environment"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The Lithium Thionyl Chloride Battery Market research report covers global current market size estimation, market situation, structure, products, leading industry players, and segmentation by types and applications.

Alison Jordan claimed drivers obstruct the pavement outside her Aberdare home \"day in, day out\" leaving her afraid to go out in case she trips and falls. The 58-year-old said drivers in her cul-de-sac, Heol Keir Hardie, have at times parked on top of her recycling bags causing rubbish to spill out. On one recent occasion empty Coke cans came loose from the bags and Ms Jordan's CCTV captured a man throwing the cans into her front garden. She said she has been complaining to Rhondda Cynon Taf council and South Wales Police about pavement parking for years but no enforcement action has been taken. An 'H-bar' road marking next to the dropped kerb outside her home lets drivers know it is an unsuitable place to park but this is only advisory and Ms Jordan claims the marking is routinely ignored. Read next: The latest list of people caught evading tax in Wales Ms Jordan, who on top of her sight problems has arthritis and other health problems following a stroke, heart attack, and cancer battle, said: \"I feel like I am being neglected. It feels like I'm invisible.\" A council spokesman said: \"We are unable to take enforcement action against vehicles that cause an obstruction including pavement parking unless they are in a regulated area, which this isn’t. These matters should be referred to South Wales Police via 101.\" And a police spokesman said Ms Jordan has been advised on several occasions that \"due to the presence of a dropped kerb no parking offences have been committed\". Alison Jordan outside her home in Aberdare (Image: Mark Lewis / WalesOnline) Ms Jordan claims the street's issues do not just include blockage of a dropped kerb but also obstructions of the pavement. After WalesOnline put it to South Wales Police that it is illegal to unnecessarily obstruct a pavement the spokesman directed us to nuisance parking guidance on the force website. The guidance says vehicles parked over dropped kerbs should be reported to the local council. If a vehicle is \"parked dangerously\" this can be reported to police, it adds. In 2020 the then-deputy transport minister Lee Waters MS announced plans to give Welsh councils powers to crack down on pavement parking. He said at the time: \"There is no specific offence of parking on pavements and though the police can enforce the existing criminal offence of causing ‘unnecessary obstruction of any part of the highway’ it is rarely enforced.\" Mr Waters set up a taskforce which earlier this year unveiled proposals to allow councils to issue £70 fines for pavement obstruction. The MS, now deputy minister for climate change, said there would be consultation \"with a view to introducing the necessary legislation by the end of 2023\". But in April Mr Waters said he had listened to feedback from council leaders and decided to delay the consultation on pavement parking until next year. He added: \"This will enable local authorities to focus on the implementation and introduction of default 20mph speed limits in September 2023 and the work to prepare for bus franchising.” Alison Jordan of Aberdare (Image: Mark Lewis / WalesOnline) Ms Jordan acknowledged her rubbish bags can \"build up a bit\" and that on some occasions this has resulted in up to 25 bags being on the pavement for collection. Because of her disabilities she sometimes needs a friend's help to bring the rubbish out and this is not possible every week, which can lead to bags accumulating. The parking issues have also left her concerned about putting the waste out, she added. Last month her housing association Trivallis wrote to her: \"I understand that you are reluctant to put your recycling bags out as a result of the cars parking on the road verge and driving over them resulting in the bags being ripped open. RCT council have stated this area is not to be used for parking but [drivers] continue to park on the verge... We are working with RCT council to try and find a resolution to this.\" A spokesman for the council said its staff had recently removed a \"large volume of waste\" from Ms Jordan's property and \"gone over and above to help the complainant in relation to removal of waste\". He added: \"We understand that there are a number of ongoing issues at this location which partners are working to resolve.” Trudy Hawkins of Trivallis said: \"We work closely with the council and other local agencies to support all of our tenants with a range of matters from waste management and littering to neighbourhood disputes and anti-social behaviour... Our neighbourhood team in Heol Keir Hardie work closely with tenants and private residents in the area to address ongoing issues and we invite those with any updates or new concerns to please report them via the neighbourhood manager or the through our customer service team on 03000 030 888.”","pubDate":"2023-07-09 13:11:51","image_url":"https://i2-prod.walesonline.co.uk/incoming/article27286014.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_Alison-Jordan-2.png","source_id":"walesonline","category":["politics","health","top","world"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Monsoonal rains swing from 10-per cent deficit to a surplus in 8 days","link":"https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/environment/monsoonal-rains-swing-from-10-per-cent-deficit-to-a-surplus-in-8-days","keywords":["Environment"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The bountiful rains in many parts of India in the first eight days of July have bridged the rainfall deficit for the entire country, according to the India Meteorological Department's (IMD) data.","content":"The bountiful rains in many parts of India in the first eight days of July have bridged the rainfall deficit for the entire country, according to the India Meteorological Department's (IMD) data.

At the end of June, the cumulative rainfall for the entire country was 148.6 mm, which was 10 per cent below the normal precipitation. However, the recent rains have significantly improved the situation. The IMD had earlier predicted normal rainfall in July, ranging from 94 to 106 per cent of the long-period average.

Three Reapers had been flying overhead searching for the militant on Friday, a U.S. defense official said, when they were harassed for about two hours by Russian aircraft. Shortly after that, the drones struck and killed Usamah al-Muhajir, who was riding a motorcycle in the Aleppo region, said the official, who was not authorized to publicly discuss the matter and spoke on condition of anonymity to describe details of the military operation. The official said al-Muhajir was in northwest Syria at the time of the strike, but that he usually operated in the east. It was not immediately clear how the U.S. military confirmed that the person killed was al-Muhajir; no other details were provided. In a statement Sunday, U.S. Central Command said there are no indications any civilians were killed in the strike. The military was assessing reports a civilian may have been injured. Friday was the third day in a row that U.S. officials complained that Russian fighter jets in the region had conducted unsafe and harassing flights around American drones. Lt. Gen. Alex Grynkewich, head of U.S. Air Forces Central Command, said in a statement that during the Friday encounter, the Russian planes “flew 18 unprofessional close passes that caused the MQ-9s to react to avoid unsafe situations.” The first friction occurred Wednesday morning when Russian military aircraft “engaged in unsafe and unprofessional behavior” as three American MQ-9 drones were conducting a mission against IS, the U.S. military said. On Thursday, the U.S. military said Russian fighter aircraft flew “incredibly unsafe and unprofessionally” against both French and U.S. aircraft over Syria. Col. Michael Andrews, Air Forces Central Command spokesman, said the Thursday incident lasted almost an hour and included close fly-bys, by one SU-34 and one SU-35 and that they deployed flares directly into the MQ-9. U.S. officials said the drones were unarmed in the earlier flights, but were carrying weapons on Friday, as they were hunting al-Muhajir. “We have made it clear that we remain committed to the defeat of ISIS throughout the region,” said Gen. Erik Kurilla, commander of U.S. Central Command, in the statement. Rear Adm. Oleg Gurinov, head of the Russian Reconciliation Center for Syria, said this past week that the Russian and Syrian militaries had started a six-day joint training that ends Monday. Gurinov added in comments carried by Syrian state media that Moscow was concerned about the flights of drones by the U.S.-led coalition over northern Syria, calling them “systematic violations of protocols” designed to avoid clashes between the two militaries.

The two-time king of SW19, 36, succumbed to a second round five-set loss as the world No.5 overhauled a 2-1 deficit exactly a decade to the day since Murray’s maiden Wimbledon title. The Scot had battled from behind under the Centre Court roof on Thursday evening before the gruelling late-night slugfest was forced to another day owing to Wimbledon’s strict 11pm curfew. And after both players were forced to resume their clash in scorching south-west London sunshine on Friday afternoon, two-time Grand Slam finalist Tsitsipas, 24, rediscovered his fluency to level in a heart-thumping fourth set tie-break before edging over the line in the decider. Murray, the current world No.40, grabbed grass court titles at both Nottingham and Surbiton last month and reckoned he was arriving at his home Grand Slam in the best shape since his second crowning glory in 2016. Stefanos Tsitsipas of Greece reacts towards the umpire against Andy Murray at Wimbledon (Image: Shaun Botterill/Getty Images) But he was unable to translate that into tangible tournament progress as Tsitsipas, ranked 35 places higher but with a questionable grass court record, silenced the home crowd and left Murray trudging off the storied Centre Court turf with more questions than answers. Asked how confident he was he will be back at the All England Club next year, Murray – who suffered second and third round exits the previous two years – said: “I don't know. “Motivation is obviously a big thing – continuing to have early losses in tournaments like this don't necessarily help with that. “It’s similar to last year – I had a long think about things, spoke to my family and decided to keep on going. “I don't plan to stop right now – but this one will take a little while to get over. “Hopefully I find the motivation again to keep training, keep pushing, try and keep getting better. “I'm obviously very disappointed just now – you never know how many opportunities you're going to get to play here. “The defeats maybe feel a bit tougher – but, to be honest, every year that Wimbledon's not gone how I would like, it's been hard.” Murray famously thrives under the Centre Court roof and turned the tables from a set behind in front of an electric Thursday night atmosphere. But with the clock ticking towards the 11pm cut-off time – in place owing to the 2009 planning application approved by Merton Council for the benefit of local residents – the indefatigable duo were forced off and asked to resume their compelling contest the following afternoon. Murray sporting an AMC hat against Stefanos Tsitsipas (Image: Visionhaus/Getty Images) Round two of this boxing match-resembling clash kicked off at 4:30pm on Friday and Tsitsipas, who has never seen eye-to-eye with Murray after a spat over the Greek’s delaying tactics at the 2021 US Open, delivered a much-improved display in front of a partisan Centre Court crowd. He levelled in a fourth set tie-break before a crucial break of serve at the beginning of the fifth left Murray with too much to do. The Scot refused to blame organisers for implementing the compulsory curfew but admits the drastic change in overnight conditions may have hampered his hopes of progression. He added: “It does change. “It's different playing indoors and outdoors – it's not the same conditions and you never know what would have happened [if we’d carried on last night]. “I don't think it necessarily favours someone more than another – it's just the way that you're playing in totally different conditions from one day to the next. “That's the biggest change, regardless of who's up in the score. “The same result could have happened – we knew that we were only going to be able to play until 11pm, so you're kind of playing to a time and it seemed like a reasonable time to stop last night. “We were told we were playing outdoors last night – there was no discussion. “My opinion is that this is an outdoor tournament – they should be trying their hardest to play as much tennis outdoors as possible.” Murray came into the SW19 with major momentum after skipping the French Open and firmly capitalising in the early grass court season events. He kicked off proceedings with a triumph at Surbiton before following it up just one week later with an even more impressive title in Nottingham. A defeat against Alex de Minaur – boyfriend of British women’s No.1 Katie Boulter – dashed his hopes of securing a seeding for Wimbledon but the Scot still descended on sport’s most famous postcode in bullish spirits. He swatted aside compatriot Ryan Peniston 6-3 6-0 6-1 in an all-British battle – his most emphatic first round victory in 15 matches at the All England Club – and had a serious chance against old foe Tsitsitas, who edged an eventful five-set epic against him at Flushing Meadows two years ago. Andy Murray of Great Britain reacts against Stefanos Tsitsipas of Greece in the Men's Singles second round match (Image: Getty Images) And the long-haired Greek emulated those exploits on Centre Court to set up a last 16 clash with Serbian Laslo Djere and keep his hopes of an unlikely maiden Grand Slam title alive. A win on Friday for Murray would have marked his greatest Wimbledon scalp – in terms of rankings – since his first All England Club triumph in 2013 and also capped his 200 th individual Grand Slam victory. He took pride in how far he pushed his more youthful opponent but was still left to rue a significant opportunity missed. “I certainly could have beaten him today or yesterday,” he added. “I certainly could have – it's clear based on how the match went and there’s only a few points in it today. “It’s not just about winning the odd match against [the top players - to have a run at these tournaments you need multiple, multiple wins in a row and I've obviously not done that, yeah... “Ultimately, this was an opportunity for me. I had a good chance of having a proper run for the first time in a long time at a slam. I didn't take it. “Regardless of the atmosphere and those things, it's still very, very disappointing to be sitting here right now.” For the latest action on the British summer grass court season, check out the LTA website","pubDate":"2023-07-09 13:00:53","image_url":"https://i2-prod.edinburghlive.co.uk/incoming/article27281859.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_JS305015618.jpg","source_id":"walesonline","category":["politics","health","top","world"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Public meetings across the Bay Area are being ‘Zoom bombed’ with hate speech–and no one knows how to stop it","link":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/07/09/public-meetings-across-the-bay-area-are-being-zoom-bombed-with-hate-speech-and-no-one-knows-how-to-stop-it/","keywords":["California News","California Politics","Latest Headlines","Local News","Local Politics","News","Politics","First Amendment","Government","Hate Crime","Race & Race Relations","Religion"],"creator":["Katie Lauer"],"video_url":null,"description":"Bay Area officials are searching for answers to combat antisemitic, homophobic and racist comments made by mostly faceless, nameless bigots.","content":"When Kevin Wilk faced antisemitism for the first time in the East Bay, it was broadcast through the speakers inside Walnut Creek’s council chambers. Wilk, the first Jewish resident to be elected to the Walnut Creek City Council in the city’s 102-year history, was bewildered when people from what he describes as the “underbelly of society” disrupted two separate June meetings with hate speech. Local governments began using Zoom to sustain participation in public meetings during the pandemic, and three years later, the vital tech is still improving resident access around the Bay Area. But it’s also become a way for bigots and trolls to interject anonymous racist and homophobic messages into city proceedings. “Now to see it in our backyard, and have people calling in to just spew antisemitism and derogatory statements towards me, purely because I’m Jewish, is stunning,” Wilk, who joined the Council in 2016 has lived in the area off and on for 50 years, said in an interview. “It makes me angry that there are people who are using anonymity to spread their hateful messages at people that they don’t know personally, but have been identified through the color of their skin, their religion, their gender identity, their ethnicity, or anything that these haters consider as ‘others.’” As government officials moved to provide remote viewing options beginning in 2020, malicious hackers started “Zoom bombing” meetings across the Bay Area, from city council proceedings in Walnut Creek, San Jose, Richmond and elsewhere, to gatherings of agencies such as the South Bay’s Valley Transportation Authority. Attendees were shocked by sudden racial slurs, pornographic images and more. Political provocateurs and unscrupulous commenters have continued bypassing added security measures using access links and codes that are legally required to be available to the public. As cities across the U.S. cope with how to quell the hateful rhetoric while ensuring freedom of speech, there seem to be more questions than clear-cut answers. Cities already prohibit vulgarity and direct threats, but how many warnings should be given before someone’s microphone is cut off? Can public meetings require identification of speakers, or introduce a lag that delays what is streamed online? Can officials limit the number of minutes or times someone speaks? tried to solve the problem last August by only allowing Zoom for basic access to municipal discussions, with comments reserved for in-person attendees only, but the backlash pushed district officials to reverse course two weeks later.

While some legal experts question the legitimacy of the view, the U.S. Supreme Court in 1952 also , which rebuked statements and publications that exposed racial or religious groups to “contempt, derision, or obloquy.” “Our First Amendment is so broad that — as the saying goes — even if I hate what you say, I’ll defend your right to say it,” Wilk said. “But freedom of speech does not mean freedom of reach. There has to be regulation, just as you can’t yell ‘fire’ in a crowded theater or incite a riot.” While city attorneys and legislators weigh their options, Wilk is adamant that these hate-speech incidents should not be ignored. “When it starts to really go beyond the boundaries of what was tolerated previously, I think it really is important to highlight that we’ve hit a touchstone now,” he said. “We’ve seen time and again throughout history, that when those kinds of comments are spread, people can become numb and almost accept them as just another opinion that they’re normalized. “That’s when the real danger occurs,” he said. Teresa Drenick, the Anti-Defamation League’s deputy regional director for the central Pacific region, said it’s vital that people report incidents of hate speech to organizations like hers, as well as local law enforcement, even when technically not dealing with criminal activity. That communication often provides the best opportunity to connect the dots about what’s happening with hate speech in the community, Drenick said. In 2021, anti-Jewish hate crimes reached an all-time high — both nationally and across California — in the 42 years that the ADL, a Jewish civil rights organization, began collecting data. Such crimes rose again last year, setting a new record. “We need to pay attention that hate crimes and antisemitism are on the rise, because we as a society need to know that it’s happening and be aware in order to combat it,” Drenick said. “The opposite is to stay silent and not say anything, and that is far worse.”","pubDate":"2023-07-09 13:00:29","image_url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/EBT-L-ZOOMHATE-07XX-01.jpg?w=1400px&strip=all","source_id":"mercurynews","category":["politics"],"country":["united states of america"],"language":"english"},{"title":"As the climate crisis intensifies, HHS refuses to do its part","link":"https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/4085604-as-the-climate-crisis-intensifies-hhs-refuses-to-do-its-part/","keywords":["Energy and Environment","Opinion"],"creator":["David Introcaso, opinion contributor"],"video_url":null,"description":"U.S. healthcare is the largest industry in the largest economy in the world; HHS should not be a cause of the climate-related health harms it reimburses the healthcare industry to alleviate.","content":"In January I the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) appeared uninterested in mitigating the healthcare industry’s massive carbon footprint. To appreciate how massive, if every nation emitted our healthcare system’s per capita rate of greenhouse gases (GHGs), the total would the entire global carbon budget to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2030. U.S. healthcare is the largest industry in the largest economy in the world; HHS should not be a cause of the climate-related health harms it reimburses the healthcare industry to alleviate. Having again failed to promulgate any regulations to mitigate industry hydrocarbons this year, and it being inconceivable to do so during the upcoming election year, HHS has in effect declared defeat. It is mortifying to realize HHS refuses to address the fact that healthcare is a climate-destroying industry and consequently guilty of . This is literally true for the approximately 160 million current Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries — those whose health and well-being HHS is responsible for protecting. The climate crisis can increase the severity of of known human pathogenic diseases. Because they are already compromised due to higher incidence rates of co-morbidities, Medicare seniors are at even related to arthropod-borne, food-borne and water-borne diseases. Extreme heat episodes are particularly deadly. Over the past 20 years, heat-related mortality among seniors has increased . Children, of whom are Medicaid beneficiaries, are uniquely vulnerable. Fine respirable particles resulting from fossil fuel use are particularly harmful because children breathe more air than adults relative to their body weight. published last year concluded the health effects to the fetus, infant and child include preterm and low-weight birth, infant death, hypertension, kidney and lung disease, immune-system dysregulation, structural and functional changes to the brain and a constellation of behavioral health diagnoses. This was not supposed to be. Immediately upon taking office, the Biden administration issued two executive orders related to the “climate crisis.” The directed all administrative departments to take any action to “reduce greenhouse gas emissions” and to “hold polluters accountable, including those who disproportionately harm communities of color and low-income communities.” The announced the administration would take a “whole of government” approach because the “government must drive … [the] mitigation of climate pollution and climate-related risks in every sector of our economy.” It ordered HHS to create a climate change office to address “the impact of climate change on the health of the American people.” When HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra launched in August the Office of Climate Change and Health Equity (OCCHE), to “use every tool at our disposal to address the climate crisis.” OCCHE immediately partnered with the National Academy of Medicine (NAM) to create an “ to decarbonize the healthcare industry. HHS also launched that month an designed to calculate environmental burden, including substandard air quality resulting from fossil fuel combustion, that minoritized people disproportionately suffer. In 2022 the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) responded via proposed regulatory rulemaking. For example, the agency’s 2023 proposed asked the public “what would incentivize [ACA health plans] to take action on decarbonization?” CMS’s proposed 2023 Medicare similarly asked “what incentives” including “payment” “might assist” hospitals and others “in taking more action on … emissions reduction.” CMS complimented these efforts by launching a related designed to reduce health disparities among minority populations in part by addressing “manmade disasters” including “climate change.” Though it amounted to virtue signaling, HHS Secretary Becerra also launched in 2022 a requesting healthcare organizations to commit to reducing their GHG emissions 50 percent by 2030 because, as the secretary stated, “every stakeholder group in America must step up, and collaboration across the public and private sector is key.” This year, however, HHS called it quits. This past March, Becerra failed to even mention healthcare’s GHG emissions in testimony before three congressional committees concerning HHS’s 2024 budget. While assessing the causes of disparities within CMS programming, the agency’s 40-page and the agency’s related March failed to recognize the fact that climate crisis poses the greatest threat to health equity, as well as the fact that HHS programming is a significant contributor. Unlike last year’s proposed inpatient rule, this year’s ignores the topic. CMS’s two proposed Medicaid rules, published in May, also ignore the topic, despite the fact that first sentence of both state they are intended to “ .” During an April OCCHE/NAM action collaborative , CMS Director Liz Fowler could only note that the Innovation Center’s affords participating plans the option of offering undefined “climate change supports in the future.” During the meeting, Jon Perlin, CEO of the Joint Commission, which certifies hospitals meet CMS performance standards, the commission was withdrawing proposed hospital accreditation sustainability standards. Though the standards also amounted to greenwashing and though it is altogether within hospitals’ financial interests to decarbonize, Perlin stated sustainability standards would be because hospitals responses were, to no one’s surprise, overwhelmingly critical.

Speculation surrounds the future of the Tottenham Hotspur captain this summer. United have been credited with an interest in England's all-time top scorer, but are exploring other options amid Spurs being reluctant to sell, especially to a domestic rival. Kane only has 12 months left to go on his contract at the North London club. This summer is the last chance Spurs realistically have to obtain a substantial fee for the striker, should he not sign a new contract, or risk seeing him walk away for free in 2024.

But the Reds retain an interest should there somehow be a shift from Spurs, who have already rejected an approach from German side Bayern Munich for the forward. Saha believes United are the only other Premier League team he could see Kane heading to should he be on the move this summer. If a move does somehow materialise, then Saha feels Kane will be a guarantee of trophies owing to his goalscoring abilities and how he can unlock defences. Speaking to Paddy Power , Saha said: “Manchester United must prioritise signing a striker this window if they want to win the big trophies. They need to have two or three players that they rely on who can trouble any defence. “The only player who has shown that they can unlock every defence is Harry Kane. That type of striker is really difficult to get - there’s probably only a few options in Europe. “If Harry Kane really wanted to leave Spurs for United, he would have mentioned it, or showed a bit of interest. It seems like he doesn’t want to make any comment on it and he’s being very professional towards Tottenham. “In terms of Manchester United, they really need a world-class striker who can play at least 30 games a season in the Premier League. They also have the Champions League to contend with now as well. I’m sad that Harry Kane to Manchester United hasn’t materialised because he would’ve been a guarantee of a trophy. “Harry Kane is waiting to see what’s happening at a few clubs before deciding his future. Real Madrid will probably be his priority now that Karim Benzema has left. Carlo Ancelotti will be looking for a striker so he might be waiting for the right move and that’s why he’s not made a decision yet. “It’s frustrating because we all want to know what Kane’s decision is, but I hope he makes the right decision. With all respect to Tottenham, Harry Kane shouldn’t stay. \"He has to consider a big move for his career and any club looking for a top striker to win trophies should go for him, because that’s what he’ll do; he’ll deliver trophies. \"Just like Robin van Persie did for Manchester United after he left Arsenal, Harry Kane will do the same. It’s between Bayern Munich, Real Madrid or Manchester United – they’re the only Premier League team I can see him going to.” Follow the MEN's United coverage on TikTok and YouTube , and subscribe to the Manchester is Red podcast","pubDate":"2023-07-09 13:00:00","image_url":"https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article27286067.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-1499849578.jpg","source_id":"manchestereveningnews","category":["world"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Next steps on new health care deal tops agenda as premiers meet in Winnipeg","link":"https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/2023/07/09/next-steps-on-new-health-care-deal-tops-agenda-as-premiers-meet-in-winnipeg.html","keywords":null,"creator":["Laura Osman - The Canadian Press"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"OTTAWA - The last time all of Canada’s premiers sat down around the same table, their attention was focused on getting Ottawa to pay more to fix the understaffed, hospitals, shuttered emergency rooms, surgical backlogs and health-worker shortages threatening the viability of their health systems. When they sit down in Winnipeg for their annual summer gathering this week, the attention will turn more to how to use the new money Ottawa has now promised. After two years of provincial pleading and sabre rattling for a new health care deal, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau finally put new money on the table at a first ministers’ meeting in Ottawa in February. That $46 billion-deal fell far short of what provinces had asked for but they were left with little choice but to accept it. Dr. Kathleen Ross, the president-elect of the Canadian Medical Association, said health must remain at the top of the agenda. “We are really on the peak of our challenges at the moment,” Ross said in an interview. “We have to change how we are managing and delivering health care in Canada.” Health care is expected to dominate the first day of the three-day meeting. Economic issues and affordability are also on the agenda. Trudeau’s new health deal includes an increase to the annual federal health transfers — which provinces use to help pay for their health care systems — as well as money for still to be negotiated one-on-one deals tailored to each province and territory to address their specific needs. The money came with conditions: each province and territory has to create targets and timelines that will be used to show that the money is being used to improve access and care. None of the provinces or territories have submitted their plans to far, and the bulk of the new money isn’t expected to flow until they do. Provinces and territories are likely to compare notes before handing their plans over to the federal government, said Nunavut Health Minister John Main, but ultimately they will be unique to the challenges in each jurisdiction. “Things are quite fragile right now in terms of our staffing,” Main said of his territory. “With the pandemic, it really changed the foundation in terms of staffing, and we also saw worsening of some types of public health issues that we’re dealing with,” including mental health and tuberculosis. Nunavut officially signed on to the deal on Thursday, as did the Northwest Territories and Yukon. That leaves Quebec as the lone holdout to officially join the pact. Setting targets is an unenviable task for provinces, Ross said, but there are common areas the CMA would like to see them focus on. They recommend a goal of eliminating backlogs for priority procedures within three years and eliminating emergency room closures, among others. In many provinces emergency rooms, particularly in smaller communities, have been closed temporarily due to staffing shortages. Provinces and territories have been critical of how much money Ottawa put on the table. The prime minister’s deal will increase the federal share of health care costs from 22 per cent to 24 per cent next year, far short of the 35 per cent the provinces and territories were demanding. “It’s the starting point,” Main said. “It’s positive to see increased transfers, but is it enough? In my opinion, no.” Health Minister Jean-Yves Duclos has called the offer “quite generous on a number of different levels.” Several provinces and territories are aiming to get their plan approved by the federal government by the end of the year, which means they may not receive much in the way of new funds until the new year. In the meantime, the federal government distributed $2 billion among provinces and territories last week to tide them over. “That was in reaction to the fact that, over the last few weeks in particular, we have seen emergency departments significantly impacted by the health human resources not being available, and backlogs in surgeries and diagnostics,” Duclos said at a press conference Thursday. Main said no province is likely to turn down one-time funds, but what they really need is stable, long-term money so they can make long-term plans. “We’re looking for predictable funding streams so that we can plan out where to direct resources and so that we have some surety in terms of building out programs or bringing on additional staffing capacity,” he said. The premiers are expected to publicly discuss how they plan to deal with the health crisis at the conclusion of their meetings on Wednesday.

Recently, Kabi WaJesus' wife, Milly WaJesus, found herself in the spotlight after expressing her admiration for American actor Keith Powers.

Some applauded Milly for her honesty, stating that it is natural to appreciate beauty regardless of one's marital status. Others, however, criticized her, suggesting that such comments could be disrespectful to her husband.

Dawn Mullholland, 54, described the NHS as 'completely broken' following her ordeal. She has submitted a formal complaint to the Liverpool University Hospital NHS Trust after her 'horrific' experience at Aintree Hospital, where she says she was left in 'incredible pain' for days. The mum-of-five said while the majority of staff were doing their best, she believes the system is so overloaded and desperate it has become dangerous. Dawn, who owns a tattoo business in Liverpool , went to the Aintree Hospital A&E department just after 5pm on Sunday, June 18 with a high temperature, acute pain in her kidney area and vomiting. She was promptly triaged, had an x-ray and bloods taken, the LiverpoolEcho reports. Dawn has made an official complaint after her treatment (Image: Liverpool Echo) By 9.30pm she was told she had a suspected kidney stone, kidney infection and possible sepsis, which can potentially be fatal. Speaking about the situation in the emergency department, Dawn said: \"It was a Sunday evening and the waiting room was chaotic. There were people fighting, I felt really vulnerable and unsafe. There was very little security.\" Dawn would go on to spend a remarkable 42 hours in that waiting room and was forced to sit on the floor in 'incredible pain', with no trolleys available. She said: \"For the duration of my 42 hour stay in the Emergency Department my clinical observations were only done twice, once in triage and once when I was having my bloods taken around two hours later. I had no other clinical observations until I was taken to the ward 42 hours later. \"I had suspected sepsis, so I should have been on antibiotics within and hour, but I didn't get them for five hours.

I was sat in excruciating pain on hard chairs and on numerous occasions on the floor. Other patients were also sat on the floor. After 36 hours I was given a trolley to sleep on with the nurse admitting that 36 hours in these conditions and in pain is ridiculous.\" Eventually, Dawn was admitted to a ward where she remained for 10 days. She is now recovering at home but says she has been scarred by her experience in hospital and deeply concerned about the state of the NHS. The 54-year-old said: \"It's horrible that people are sat on the floor in incredible pain and not getting the treatment they need. The majority of staff are trying their very best but their hands are tied. They are working under the shocking conditions that they are working in, however the system is broken and desperately needs fixing.\" \"I spoke to so many nurses who were all really struggling. They actually told me to make a complaint because they think that's the only way things might change.\" \"The whole system is just completely broken. I wouldn't want to go back into that hospital to be honest.\" In January of this year Aintree's emergency department was handed a rating of inadequate by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), who inspected the service last October. The CQC found that patients were 'at risk of harm' in the overwhelmed department, which had exceeded its maximum capacity during the inspection. Dawn said: \"That inadequate rating was released in January of this year. I would like to know what plans have been put in place to turn things around and improve things for patients. I know how difficult things are but what is the trust doing to make things better?\" Dr Peter Turkington, executive managing director of Aintree University Hospital, said: “I’d like to apologise to Dawn for her experience at our hospital and we are in touch to address her concerns directly. \"Staff in our A&E department are working incredibly hard to deliver safe care in what remain very challenging circumstances, with high demand and very sick patients, and we will learn from Dawn’s experience to ensure we identify and implement areas for improvement.”","pubDate":"2023-07-09 12:56:16","image_url":"https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/article27286940.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_AintreeED.jpg","source_id":"walesonline","category":["politics","health","top","world"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Southampton Let's Rock 2023: Pictures of the amazing acts","link":"https://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/23643568.southampton-rock-2023-pictures-amazing-acts/?ref=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Music fans flocked to Southampton Common to enjoy 80s-themed festival Let's Rock","content":"MUSIC fans flocked to Southampton Common yesterday to enjoy an 80s-themed festival.
