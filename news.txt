The same day, but under the radar of the mainstream news media and public, the unelected body with lifetime terms made its full objective crystal clear. The six far-right majority Justices of the Court upheld a century-old Mississippi amendment to its state constitution that was used during the “Jim Crow” segregationist era to deny Black people in the state the right to vote and fully participate as equals. The president of the 1890 constitutional convention that adopted the amendment made it clear, saying: “We came here to exclude the Negro.” By a six-to-three vote, the Court rejected hearing a challenge to the amendment. Four Justices are required to vote in favour for a case to be heard The state argued that the provision is no longer tainted by the racist intentions of its original authors. Why then leave it in the constitution? The court's decision prompted a sharp dissenting opinion from Justice, Ketanji Brown Jackson — the first Black woman appointed to the Court. She was joined by liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the first Latina on the court. Jackson exposed the Court majority’s hypocrisy, and contrasted its decision with the ban on affirmative action in college admissions. If the court viewed affirmative action as race discrimination, she said, then the Mississippi measure must be seen similarly. \"Mississippians can only hope they will not have to wait another century for another judicial knight-errant,\" she wrote. \"Constitutional wrongs do not right themselves.\" The measure was first enacted at a time when whites in the Deep South were fighting back against post-Civil War efforts to ensure formerly enslaved Black people had equal rights. The 14th Amendment, adopted in the post-Civil War Reconstruction period, bars states from limiting the right to vote because of race. To get around it, Southern states adopted various laws and practices that outlawed Black voting rights. Mississippi’s constitutional amendment effectively prevents Black people from voting, by removing voting rights from felons convicted of what were thought to be \"Black crimes\", but declines to do the same for \"white crimes”. Other Southern states adopted laws with the same effect. Innocent Black people were convicted under the so-called “Black Codes”, which kept former freed people as second class citizens to whites. So-called “separate but equal” laws were passed. Black people in the southern states were segregated — including in where they could get medical care and education — for nearly a century until the mass civil rights movement won. Today, those convicted of permanently lose the right to vote in Mississippi. This has a staggering effect. Sixteen percent of the Black voting-age population (and 10% of overall voters) are barred from casting a ballot, . Mississippi’s population is about 38% Black, but Black people make up more than half of those disenfranchised. Once a person loses their right to vote, it is essentially impossible to get it back. A disenfranchised person must get the legislature to approve an individual bill on their behalf by a super majority in both chambers, for the governor to approve the bill. There are no online instructions or applications, and lawmakers can deny an application for any reason. Disenfranchised people rarely make it through the process. From 1997‒2022, on average, only seven people were successful each year, according to Blake Feldman, a criminal justice researcher in Mississippi. Prior to reaching the Supreme Court, a federal district judge and the US court of appeals for the Fifth Circuit each upheld Mississippi s policy. In its decision, the Fifth Circuit court claimed that modifications to the policy in 1950 and 1968 got rid of any discrimination. In 1974, the Supreme Court upheld that states could bar voting rights to those convicted of felonies. Since no Justice wrote a reason for not hearing the Mississippi appeal, it is assumed they saw it fitting alongside its earlier stance. Jackson and Sotomayor were the only two justices who declared their dissent. In her opinion, Jackson argued the Fifth Circuit Court had committed “two egregious analytical errors that ought to be corrected”. The Mississippi case shows that the Court’s decision was political and not based on the Constitution. Once again, the basic democratic rights of Black people are denied.","pubDate":"2023-07-10 00:29:31","image_url":null,"source_id":"greenleft","category":["world"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Lawmakers berate IAEA chief over plans to release treated Fukushima wastewater","link":"https://macaudailytimes.com.mo/lawmakers-berate-iaea-chief-over-plans-to-release-treated-fukushima-wastewater.html","keywords":["Asia-Pacific","South Korea-Japan"],"creator":["-"],"video_url":null,"description":"South Korean opposition lawmakers sharply criticized the head of the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog yesterday for its approval of Japanese plans to release treated wastewater from the damaged Fukushima nuclear power plant.

They met with Rafael Grossi in a tense meeting in Seoul that took place while protesters screamed outside the door. Grossi, the International Atomic Energy Agency’s director general, arrived in South Korea over the weekend to engage with government officials and critics and help reduce public concerns about food safety. The IAEA last week approved the Japanese discharge plans, saying the process would meet international safety standards and pose negligible environmental and health impacts. South Korea’s government has also endorsed the safety of the Japanese plans. In his meeting with members of the liberal Democratic Party, which controls a majority in South Korea’s parliament, Grossi said the IAEA’s review of the Japanese plans was based on “transparent” and “scientific” research. He acknowledged concerns over how the Japanese plans would play out in reality and said the IAEA would establish a permanent office in Fukushima to closely monitor how the discharge process is implemented over the next three decades. “Our conclusion has been that this plan, if it is carried out in the way it has been presented, would be in line, would be in conformity with the international safety standards,” Grossi said. The lawmakers responded by harshly criticizing IAEA’s review, which they say neglected long-term environmental and health impacts of the wastewater release and threatens to set a bad precedent that may encourage other countries to dispose nuclear waste into sea. They called for Japan to scrap the discharge plans and work with neighboring countries to find safer ways to handle the wastewater, including a possible pursuit of long-term storage on land. The party has also criticized the government of South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol for putting people’s health at risk while trying to improve relations with Japan. “If you think (the treated wastewater) is safe, I wonder whether you would be willing to suggest the Japanese government use that water for drinking or for industrial and agricultural purposes, rather than dumping it in the sea,” Woo Won-shik, a Democratic Party lawmaker who attended the meeting, told Grossi. The party said Woo has been on a hunger strike for the past 14 days to protest the Japanese discharge plans. Further details from the meeting weren’t immediately available after reporters were asked to leave following opening statements. Closely watched by parliamentary security staff, dozens of protesters shouted near the lobby of the National Assembly’s main hall where the meeting was taking place, holding signs denouncing the IAEA and Japan.

Those calculations happened to carve a path right through the same projected 10km range that came from the US government. Loeb and his crew took a boat called the Silver Star out to the area. The ship took numerous passes along and around the meteor's projected path. Researchers combed the ocean floor by attaching a sled full of magnets to their boat. \"We found ten spherules. These are almost perfect spheres, or metallic marbles.

The PGA Tour confirmed the resignation in a memo to its members, referring to Stephenson’s “exemplary service” for more than 12 years. Stephenson retired as chairman and CEO of AT&T in June 2020. The Post said it obtained a copy of his letter that was dated Saturday and said the tour’s framework agreement with Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund “is not one that I can objectively evaluate or in good conscience support, particularly in light of the U.S. intelligence report concerning Jamal Khashoggi in 2018.” Khashoggi, a Washington Post contributing columnist and critic of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was slain at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018. U.S. intelligence concluded the crown prince likely approved the killing, which the crown prince denies. PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan stunned every corner of the golf world — including his own membership — when he announced on June 6 a partnership with the PIF, which had paid for the rival league LIV Golf and was part of antitrust lawsuits. The agreement, which still requires PGA Tour board approval and is being looked at by the Justice Department, would create a for-profit company in which the PIF, the PGA Tour and the European tour would pool their commercial business and media rights. Monahan would be the CEO and Yasir Al-Rumayyan, the PIF governor, would be chairman of the new company. Al-Rumayyan also would have a seat on the PGA Tour board, though the PGA had assurances in the preliminary deal that it would always have a majority vote. Stephenson said he intended to resign on June 12, but then Monahan stepped away with a medical issue. Monahan announced Friday he would return to work on July 17. “I joined this board 12 years ago to serve the best players in the world and to expand the virtues of sportsmanship instilled through the game of golf,” Stephenson said in his letter. “I hope, as this board moves forward, it will comprehensively rethink its governance model and keep its options open to evaluate alternative sources of capital beyond the current framework agreement.” The 10-member PGA Tour board consists of five players and five independent directors. Two of them are board chairman Ed Herlihy and Jimmy Dunne, who joined Monahan in negotiating the deal over seven weeks with Al-Rumayyan. The others are investment manager Mark Flaherty, a board member for Goldman Sachs, and Mary Meeker, a venture capitalist. Fridays The Free Press sports editor keeps you up to date on all that’s happening on the ice, the field, the court, and places in between. The resignation comes three days before Dunne and Ron Price, the tour’s COO, are to testify before a Congressional subcommittee that wants more details on the partnership between the PGA Tour and the Saudi wealth fund. According to the tour’s bylaws, the four independent directors are to choose who replaces Stephenson after consulting with the five players on the board and John Lindert, the PGA of America president who is a non-voting board member.

He was 69. Herron died at Vanderbilt Medical Center in Nashville, according to a statement from his family. He had been hospitalized since a July 1 collision with another jet ski on Kentucky Lake, in which he suffered internal bleeding and extensive injuries to his arm and pelvis, according to his family’s Caring Bridge website. The Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency was investigating the collision, the details of which were not immediately available. “Roy loved his family with all his might,” Herron’s wife, Rev. Nancy Carol Miller-Herron, said. “He passed doing what he loved most — spending time with our sons and their friends in the Tennessee outdoors where his spirit was always most free.” Herron, an attorney from Dresden, Tennessee, served a combined 26 years in the state’s House and Senate, where he became floor leader and caucus chair for the Democrats. He never missed a day of session, except for when his youngest son was born, according to his website. He chaired the state Democratic Party from 2013 to 2015. A graduate of the University of Tennessee at Martin, Herron was also one of the first students to earn joint degrees in divinity and law from Vanderbilt University. An ordained Methodist minister, Herron also authored three books, including one titled, “God and Politics: How Can a Christian Be in Politics?” Funeral services were planned for Saturday at First United Methodist Church in Martin. Condolences poured in on Sunday. On Twitter, former Vice President Al Gore called his fellow Tennessee Democrat “a dear friend and one of Tennessee’s most devoted citizens.” Democratic Rep. Steve Cohen called Herron “bright, diligent, and honest. A politician destined for greatness.” Republican Rep. David Kustoff said Herron ”dedicated his life to serving West Tennessee, and the entire Volunteer State.” Tennessee House Republican Caucus Chairman Jeremy Faison said on Twitter he was “the kind of guy that you couldn’t help but like.” Joe Hill, a longtime Tennessee Democratic political operative who worked with Herron on multiple campaigns, said he “brought a zeal for making health care more accessible to disadvantaged Tennesseans” when he was elected to the state House. Hill said he also brought that commitment to “education, victims’ rights, environmental quality and so many other things that affect average people.” “His legacy of advocating for ‘the least among us’ will represent the gold standard of service for Democrats and Republicans in Tennessee’s future,” Hill told The Associated Press on Sunday. That nature applied to Herron’s friendships as well, Hill said. He recalled how Herron drove 140 miles (225 kilometers) to be with him and his family in Memphis, after one of Hill’s children was involved in a car crash. “We left home in such a hurry and didn’t bring extra clothes,” Hill said. “My wife, Susan, was freezing in the cold hospital waiting room, and Roy gave her his shirt so she could be warm. That’s the kind of genuine human being he was.” In 2010, after briefly running for governor, Herron became the Democratic nominee in Tennessee’s 8th Congressional District, when then-Rep. John Tanner announced his retirement, after more than 20 years in the seat. Herron ultimately lost the general election to Republican Stephen Fincher. “I was hoping when I retired, that he would win the seat,” Tanner told the AP on Sunday. After a tornado devastated his hometown of Dresden just before Christmas in 2021, Herron marshaled a fundraising effort, amassing more than $100,000 to aid recovery efforts. “It’s an overused term — that he was a dedicated public servant — but that really was Roy,” Tanner said. “He worked tirelessly for causes that he took up, and he had a good heart.” ___ Meg Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP Advertisement","pubDate":"2023-07-10 00:05:59","image_url":null,"source_id":"winnipegfreepress","category":["world"],"country":["canada"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Why Auckland bus drivers went on strike today - First Union","link":"http://www.voxy.co.nz/national/5/419123","keywords":["National"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"FIRST Union, the largest bus drivers’ union in Aotearoa, says this morning’s bus strike of seven NZ Bus depots in Auckland was necessary and successful, and is challenging \"misleading\" claims by the employer (NZ Bus) and Auckland Transport over the last day.","content":"FIRST Union, the largest bus drivers’ union in Aotearoa, says this morning’s bus strike of seven NZ Bus depots in Auckland was necessary and successful, and is challenging \"misleading\" claims by the employer (NZ Bus) and Auckland Transport over the last day. \"This strike is in no way a surprise to NZ Bus, or really a ‘last-minute’ strike at all - we have warned them again and again that drivers are not being listened to during bargaining and have already delayed strike action twice during the last month as negotiations continued fruitlessly,\" said Hayley Courtney, FIRST Union organiser. \"NZ Bus were more than aware that strike action was likely and they did very little to prepare for it because they don’t take their drivers seriously.\" \"The subsequent claims made by NZ Bus and Auckland Transport about the current offer on the table for bus drivers are absolute nonsense.\" \"The company’s latest offer would reduce the effective pay rate for most drivers by only increasing the base rate for drivers who work exclusively non-penal hours - a very small number - while the majority would still not earn $30 per hour imminently, despite assurances from the Mayor and politicians.\" \"What this means is that most drivers who work overtime or on penal rates due to enduring staff shortages would be worse off and doing more for less under the company’s plan.\" Ms Courtney also said drivers were extremely concerned that a new tranche of migrant drivers, aimed to fill these longstanding labour shortages, would end up being paid more (at a base rate) than local drivers who work for a combination of base and penal rates under the current Collective Agreement \"Drivers are telling me this morning that NZ Bus have been approaching new migrant drivers and telling them they will be sent home to their countries of origin if they are to join a union, which is not only misleading but desperate union-busting behaviour,\" said Ms Courtney. \"We’re in mediation with the company today and are hopeful that we can find a solution, but in all honesty, so far we’ve seen surface-level bargaining by NZ Bus and our members felt the strike action was their only option to be heard - that must change today.\" \"It’s frustrating that the bus industry is finally moving away from the low-cost contracting model and onto a more sustainable path for the recruitment and retention of drivers through a Fair Pay Agreement, but employers like NZ Bus are jeapordising future progress by clinging to the poor practices of the past.\"","pubDate":"2023-07-09 23:59:23","image_url":null,"source_id":"voxy","category":["world"],"country":["new zealand"],"language":"english"},{"title":"What matters most in Ruawai - Kaipara District Council","link":"http://www.voxy.co.nz/national/5/419122","keywords":["National"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The Ruawai community have identified that flood protection, people, whÄnau, environment, cultural connection, local businesses and farming are the things they really care about.

In all, six apparently random shootings occurred in Brooklyn and Queens on Saturday, according to police. The motive of the alleged gunman, identified Sunday as 25-year-old Thomas Abreu, was unknown, police said. Police arrested Abreu without incident Saturday. The New York Police Department pulled an image of the gunman from video and sent it to officers, who spotted him a couple hours after the first shooting, police said. Police confiscated a scooter and a 9 mm handgun with an extended magazine. Abreu was charged with murder, two counts of attempted murder and six counts of criminal possession of a weapon. The shootings began around 11:10 a.m., when the gunman shot a 21-year-old man in the shoulder in Brooklyn. The man was brought to a hospital and was expected to survive, police said. Soon after, Abreu allegedly shot Hamoo Saeidi, 86, of Queens, in the Richmond Hill area of Queens. Saeidi later died at a hospital. Shortly afterward in Queens, witnesses reported a man on a scooter firing randomly into a group of people, although nobody was hurt. Eight minutes later, a 44-year-old man was shot in the face. He was in critical condition at Jamaica Hospital Medical Center. About one minute later, a 63-year-old man was shot in the torso. He was in stable condition at a hospital. On Sunday, police reported a sixth related shooting at an intersection in Queens. A 40-year-old man fired upon was unhurt. Killings in the nation’s most populous city have risen in recent years to about where they were a decade ago but still well below an early-1990s peak. Gunfire injuries surged in New York City during the pandemic and remain stubbornly high. The city has confronted a series of high-profile crimes. Mayor Eric Adams, a former New York City police captain, has called for getting more guns off the streets.

Kimbrady Carriker, 40, was arraigned Wednesday morning on five counts of murder, attempted murder, aggravated assault and weapons counts of possession without a license and carrying firearms in public, prosecutors said. While authorities initially believed Carriker killed Joseph Wamah Jr., 31, in a home as part of a quickly orchestrated series of shootings, Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner said Sunday that an error prevented police from discovering Wamah’s body right away. ‘”It has been determined through information received through a source and corroborated by the Philadelphia Medical Examiner’s Office and additional evidence; that homicide victim Joseph Wamah, Jr. was killed by suspect Kimbrady Carriker approximately 44 hours before the mass shooting,” Krasner’s office said in a statement. Authorities said Philadelphia Police responded to a 911 call about gunshots about 2 a.m. July 2 on South 56th Street, about 90 minutes after they now believe Wamah was killed. However, police were accidentally dispatched to North 56th Street, so they didn’t find Wamah’s body right away. “The grieving family of the deceased has been briefed on this new information, and I cannot express enough the sorrow I feel,” Krasner said. A 2-year-old and a 13-year-old were also wounded by gunfire and another 2-year-old boy and a woman were hit by shattered glass in the rampage that made the working-class area in southwest Philadelphia the site of the nation’s worst violence around the July Fourth holiday.

Dairy Environment Leaders is a DairyNZ-supported farmer initiative launched 14 years ago and now involves 400 dairy farmer members nationwide, who work with dairy farmers, communities and decision-makers to drive positive progress. DairyNZ general manager for sustainable dairy, Dr David Burger, says Dairy Environment Leaders have a focus on sharing the sector’s great work and leading by example, in reducing environmental footprint. \"Amber has a diverse background and brings excellent strategic and relationship-building skills to the role, and we look forward to her supporting the Dairy Environment Leaders network to continue its positive work around New Zealand,\" says David. Along with the national leadership role, Amber will also support the network’s regional committees, connecting and influencing other farmers, and fostering a sense of community. \"The Dairy Environment Leaders network helps dairy farmers and rural communities navigate the changes and challenges ahead,\" says Amber. \"Together, we can make a huge difference.\" Amber and her husband Fraser are sharemilkers on a Paparimu dairy and beef farm, milking 450 cows. They’re now in their ninth season. The couple put a plan in place every season to lower their environmental footprint, such as reducing nitrogen and fertiliser inputs, as well as imported feed. \"As sharemilkers we work with what is in our control,\" Amber says. \"Understanding our numbers is key. Working with farm owners who value environmental sustainability is important to us and we appreciate working with farm owners on Farm Environment Plans, particularly being involved in the conversations when it comes to planting and fencing off wetlands. \"All the small changes each day and each season help us make a bigger overall impact.\" The Dairy Environment Leaders chair role appeals to Amber as a way to help drive change for a better future. Formerly working in the fashion industry, she swapped heels for gumboots in 2018, after many years supporting Fraser on-farm on a part-time basis. \"After we had our first son I realised I needed to decide whether to continue an urban life following my career, or live a rural life following Fraser’s,\" she says. Now Amber can’t imagine doing anything else - and wants to give back to the sector she’s grown to love. \"I see the Dairy Environment Leaders chair role as a great opportunity to put my skills and experience to great use and give back to an industry my family and I are grateful to be a part of,\" Amber says. \"We all experience similar challenges and need to support each other in a fast-changing environment.\" Amber replaces Waikato dairy farmer Melissa Slattery as chair. Melissa has stepped down to focus more on her farm and family - and to enable a fellow Dairy Environment Leader to further develop their leadership. \"Melissa played a key role in driving environmental change across New Zealand over her three years in the role,\" David says. \"We appreciate her strong leadership, advocacy and hard work over the past three years and wish her well for the future.\" Visit Dairy Environment Leaders Forum - DairyNZ for more information about the Dairy Environment Leaders network.","pubDate":"2023-07-09 23:10:39","image_url":null,"source_id":"voxy","category":["world"],"country":["new zealand"],"language":"english"},{"title":"South Korea’s Yoon pushes for strong resolve against North’s nuclear ambitions at NATO summit","link":"https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/breakingnews/2023/07/09/south-koreas-yoon-pushes-for-strong-resolve-against-norths-nuclear-ambitions-at-nato-summit","keywords":["Top News","World"],"creator":["Feedloaderapi"],"video_url":null,"description":"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s president says it’s time to clearly demonstrate strong international resolve to deter North Korea’s nuclear ambitions, and plans to discuss how to cope […]","content":"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s president says it’s time to clearly demonstrate strong international resolve to deter North Korea’s nuclear ambitions, and plans to discuss how to cope with the North’s expanding weapons arsenal with NATO leaders this week.

To continue reading, please subscribe: + GST for 9 weeks of unlimited access* SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s president says it’s time to clearly demonstrate strong international resolve to deter North Korea’s nuclear ambitions, and plans to discuss how to cope with the North’s expanding weapons arsenal with NATO leaders this week. Yoon Suk Yeol will attend the annual NATO summit being held this year in Vilnius, Lithuania, on Tuesday and Wednesday as part of a two-nation trip that includes a stop in Poland. “Now is the time to clearly demonstrate that the international community’s determination to deter North Korea’s nuclear weapons program is stronger than North Korea’s desire to develop nuclear weapons,” he said. It’s the second consecutive year that Yoon will take part in the summit, underscoring his push to deepen ties with the world’s biggest military alliance. South Korea faces a mix of security challenges, including North Korea’s nuclear program and the U.S.-China strategic rivalry. Last year, he became the first South Korean leader to attend a NATO summit when he took part in Spain. In written responses to questions from The Associated Press ahead of his departure, Yoon said South Korea will stress at the NATO meeting the importance of international cooperation against “North Korea’s illegal acts.” He also said a new NATO-South Korean document will take effect at the summit to institutionalize cooperation in 11 areas, including non-proliferation and cybersecurity. North Korea’s headlong pursuit of reliable nuclear weapons has taken on a new sense of urgency after it test flew more than 100 missiles and openly threatened to use nuclear weapons in potential conflicts with South Korea and the United States since the start of last year. Whether North Korea possesses functioning nuclear missiles is still a source of debate. But according to a South Korean government estimate in 2018, North Korea already had up to 60 nuclear warheads. Experts say North Korea is able to add six to 18 new warheads to its arsenal every year. In response to North Korea’s torrid pace of missile tests, Yoon, a conservative who took office in May 2022, took steps to beef up his country’s own missile capability and expand military drills with the United States. Yoon and U.S. President Joe Biden in April announced plans to reinforce their countries’ deterrence capabilities, such as the periodic docking of a U.S. nuclear-armed submarine in South Korea and the establishment of a new bilateral nuclear consultative group, whose inaugural meeting is slated for next week in Seoul. Yoon’s discussion of North Korea with NATO leaders could trigger a backlash from North Korea, which has already called increasing cooperation between NATO and U.S. allies in Asia a process to create an “Asian version of NATO” that it said will raise regional animosities. North Korea argues its weapons testing spree was meant to issue a warning over the expanded South Korean-U.S. military drills that it views as invasion rehearsals. Yoon says he wants to opt for peace through strength, though he remains open to dialogue with North Korea. “Peace is never as certain and reliable as when it is backed by powerful force and deterrence,” Yoon added. “Strong international sanctions against North Korea have the effect of preventing the advancement of its nuclear and missile capabilities.” In Vilnius, Yoon said that there will be “several opportunities” for him to speak with Biden over a range of topics, such as the strengthening of the U.S. security commitment and the expansion of trilateral security cooperation between Seoul, Washington and Tokyo. Yoon said he and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida also plan to hold a bilateral meeting there. He said he and Kishida will be able to discuss the advancement of bilateral relations but also ways to expand mutual solidarity and international cooperation. Relations between South Korea and Japan have improved significantly in recent months, with Yoon taking a major step toward resolving a thorny dispute over Japan’s colonial-era mobilization of forced Korean laborers. The Yoon-Kishida meeting in Vilnius is expected to touch upon Japan’s contentious plans to release treated wastewater from the crippled Fukushima nuclear power plant, which was recently approved by the U.N. nuclear watchdog but is still opposed by many in neighboring countries. During the two-day summit in Vilnius, NATO leaders are expected to offer more help in modernizing Ukraine’s armed forces as the Russian invasion of the country continues with no end in sight. They are also expected to create a new high-level forum for consultations and reaffirm that Ukraine will join their alliance one day. Weekday Mornings A quick glance at the news for the upcoming day. Yoon said South Korea has provided humanitarian and financial support to Ukraine in a variety of forms and that supplies of de-mining equipment, ambulances and other materials “are in the works” following a recent request from Ukraine. He said South Korea has also already provided support to repair the damaged Kakhovka Dam in Ukraine. South Korea, a growing arms exporter, has avoided directly providing arms to Ukraine in line with its long-standing policy of not supplying weapons to countries actively engaged in conflict. Leaked U.S. intelligence documents posted online earlier this year indicated that South Korea’s National Security Council “grappled” with the U.S. in early March over an American request to provide artillery ammunition to Ukraine. “The Korean government will continue to fulfill its necessary role in tandem with the international community in order to safeguard the freedom of Ukraine,” Yoon said. “On top of this, we will work out multipronged support measures needed for the prompt post-war restoration of peace in Ukraine and its reconstruction.” Yoon is invited to the NATO summit along with the leaders of Japan, Australia and New Zealand, a sign of strengthening ties between NATO and nations in the Asia-Pacific region. The four countries were invited to last year’s summit as well. “Just as incidents in Europe can have a substantial and consequential impact on the Indo-Pacific region, Indo-Pacific events can have immense ramifications for countries in Europe,” Yoon said. “In particular, the war in Ukraine has reminded us all that a security crisis in one particular region can have a global impact.” Advertisement","pubDate":"2023-07-09 23:03:11","image_url":null,"source_id":"winnipegfreepress","category":["world"],"country":["canada"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Big Brothers Big Sisters The Big Breakfast and live auction","link":"http://www.voxy.co.nz/national/5/419117","keywords":["National"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cillín Hearns is guest speaker at Big Brothers Big Sisters of Wellington’s The Big Breakfast on Friday 28 July at the Hutt Bowling Club for a delicious breakfast, live auction and fundraising.","content":"Cillín Hearns is guest speaker at Big Brothers Big Sisters of Wellington’s The Big Breakfast on Friday 28 July at the Hutt Bowling Club for a delicious breakfast, live auction and fundraising.

The two organisations have released a powerful video which features ordinary Kiwis calling for immediate action on modern slavery, along with an open letter calling for action which they hope thousands of New Zealanders will sign. Tearfund’s Head of Advocacy, Claire Gray, says the two agencies are frustrated at the government’s lack of action to introduce laws requiring New Zealand businesses to identify modern slavery in their operations and supply chains and take action to address them. \"After years of advocacy from the business community, overwhelming support from Kiwis, petitions, and participation in a government consultation process, we still don’t have modern slavery legislation. It’s not good enough,\" she says. World Vision’s Advocacy spokesperson, Morgan Theakston, says the time for empty promises from the Government is over. \"We have had numerous indications from the government that modern slavery legislation will progress to in 2023, but there has been no action. Meanwhile, more than 27 million people remain trapped in forced labour-many of them in our own backyard in Asia and the Pacific. There is no more time to waste,\" she says. The video features ordinary Kiwis who represent the eight out of ten New Zealanders who recently indicated their support for modern slavery law in a Talbot Mills Research poll.

Azarenka, who’s from Belarus, had just lost a third-set tiebreaker and — knowing that Svitolina does not shake hands with Russian and Belarusian players after matches in protest of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine — walked directly to the umpire to shake hands. The two-time Grand Slam champion also seemed to give a slight wave to Svitolina, who won 2-6, 6-4, 7-6 (9). But as she gathered her equipment and began walking off No. 1 Court — where the crowd had been rooting for Svitolina — boos rained down. “I can’t control the crowd. I’m not sure that a lot of people were understanding what’s happening,” Azarenka said, suggesting the crowd had been drinking. “It wasn’t fair. It is what it is. What can I do?” It wasn’t clear if fans thought Azarenka snubbed Svitolina, but the Belarusian shook her head as she walked off and banged her hands or fists together over her head. At the French Open, it was the other way around for Ukrainian players. Marta Kostyuk was booed when she didn’t shake hands at the net with Aryna Sabalenka of Belarus. Svitolina said she was also booed in Paris. Thursdays Keep up to date on sports with Mike McIntyre's weekly newsletter. “For me personally, I think the tennis organizations, they have to come out with a statement that there will be no handshake between Russian, Belarusian, and Ukrainian players,” Svitolina said. “I don’t know if it’s maybe not clear for people. Some people not really know what is happening. So I think this is the right way to do.” The 33-year-old Azarenka, who moved from Belarus to the United States as a teenager, said she’s always had a good relationship with Svitolina. “But what can I say about the crowd? There is nothing to say,” Azarenka said. “She doesn’t want to shake hands with Russian, Belarusian people. I respected her decision. What should I have done? Stayed and waited? Like, I mean, there’s no thing that I could do that would have been right, so I just did what I thought was respectful towards her decision.” ___ AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports Advertisement","pubDate":"2023-07-09 22:00:06","image_url":null,"source_id":"winnipegfreepress","category":["world"],"country":["canada"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Kaipara District Mayoral Relief Fund distributes 119 grants","link":"http://www.voxy.co.nz/national/5/419109","keywords":["National"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The Kaipara District Mayoral Relief Fund gave out a total of $532,443.94 to residents and ratepayers in the Kaipara district.","content":"The Kaipara District Mayoral Relief Fund gave out a total of $532,443.94 to residents and ratepayers in the Kaipara district.

Having a single line running while crews worked on the other line, has meant that the project could proceed at pace while keeping around 400 workers safe from the risks of a live rail line.

It is another incremental step towards a world-class rail network for Auckland. \"Our teams are working hard across the city on a range of other complementary improvement projects - from our Rail Network Rebuild, which is raising the standards of the tracks across the whole network; building a Third Main Line in South Auckland to better separate commuter and freight trains; extending the electrified network to Papakura; and building new stations to support housing growth around Drury.\" Auckland Transport’s Executive General Manager Public Transport Services Stacey van der Putten says Western Line passengers will benefit from meaningful time savings now that trains can use both tracks through Maungawhau Station in Mt Eden. \"Customers on the Western Line will spend less time travelling as a result of this change, with even more significant time savings in store when the City Rail Link opens,\" Ms van der Putten says. \"We’re really grateful to our customers on the Western Line for their patience over the past three years and we’re glad to be able to improve the speed and reliability of their journeys from today. \"I’d also like to thank our AT operational teams and Auckland One Rail train crews for their hard work over the past few years to make sure that our Western Line services could run safely and with the least possible disruption while we were down to one line through Maungawhau.\" The works involved the replacement of 1.3km of dual track, with the total length of the ballasted track built totalling 2,860m, including connections to the City Rail Link lines. The rebuilt section of line involved approximately 4,375 sleepers, 10,751 tonnes of ballast, 71 sections of 70m-long rail, 50 masts, more than 3.7km of overhead line contact wire and 1.6km of feeder wire. More than 150,000m3 of spoil was removed for Western Line tracks and the location of new City Rail Link tracks at western and eastern links. Sustainability efforts saw 81,720kgs of temporary prop steel beams on the eastern grade separation sold to a company that will store and resell to another project for reuse. When complete and operational, the City Rail Link project will deliver significantly improved travel times for commuters. From Maungawhau Station, it will take only three minutes to get to Karanga-a-Hape Station, six minutes to Te Waihorotiu Station and nine minutes to WaitematÄ Station (Britomart).","pubDate":"2023-07-09 21:38:21","image_url":null,"source_id":"voxy","category":["world"],"country":["new zealand"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Joe Biden Arrives In UK For Meetings With King Charles, Rishi Sunak","link":"https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/joe-biden-arrives-in-uk-for-meetings-with-king-charles-rishi-sunak-4192453","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"US President Joe Biden on Sunday landed in Britain where he will meet the UK's Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and King Charles III before continuing to Lithuania for a NATO summit.","content":"US President Joe Biden on Sunday landed in Britain.

United's ongoing negotiations have rumbled on past his contract's expiry and hung over the player's wedding. leaving a bad taste in the mouth of many. But, as is the way with football, the Reds need to move on quickly and they look set to. MEN Sport understands United are confident of securing a deal for Inter Milan's Andre Onana to become the new No.1. Here's what he said. Cole outlines Mason Mount hope Andy Cole believes the signing of Mason Mount is a positive one for Manchester United and hopes the midfielder can play his part in taking the Reds back closer to the top. Mount has become United's first signing of the summer transfer window. He has penned a five-year deal with the option of a further 12 months following his move from Chelsea. United had to be patient to land the 24-year-old England international after the Stamford Bridge side aimed to secure the biggest fee possible for a player who was out of contract in 2024. Eventually after a couple of bids were turned down by Chelsea, an initial fee of £55m plus an extra £5m in performance-related add-ons was agreed. Keep reading.

Someone got the timing wrong Sunday at the oldest Grand Slam tournament, where the bubbly helps wash down the strawberries and cream. “Ladies and gentlemen, please, if you are opening a bottle of Champagne don’t do it as the player is about to serve. Thank you,” Australian umpire John Blom announced just after the start of a match on No. 3 Court. Anastasia Potapova smiled and nodded in approval. The 22nd-seeded player was serving to start her third-round match against teenager Mirra Andreeva. When she tossed the ball in the air a cork popped and she sent the serve long. She then lost the point on her second serve, and the umpire’s warning followed. Lanson Champagne is available on the grounds of the All England Club by the glass, half-bottle and bottle. “Le White Label Sec” goes for 95.10 pounds ($122) for a bottle. “Usually, actually, we buy it here, but it’s quite nice that you can actually bring your own in, which I didn’t realize until my husband looked it up this morning,” said Sarah-Jane Watson, a lawyer from Surrey. It’s true, you can. “We brought a bottle,” she said, “and then we bought a bottle.” They watched matches at No. 2 Court, where a security guard asked that they not open the bottle inside. A cork was heard popping at Centre Court, though, between points during a match featuring Iga Swiatek and Belinda Bencic. The 32nd-seeded Marie Bouzkova said she’s too dialed in to be distracted. The Czech Republic native, who lost to Marketa Vondrousova, said during a match a couple of years ago she hadn’t noticed a fire alarm going off in a nearby building. “I was like ‘what fire alarm?’” she said. Though there’s at least one place, she added, that’s a bit louder than average: Flushing Meadows. “In New York,” Bouzkova said, “you have more outside noise, I would say, just from the crowd either drinking maybe too much beer or just being a little bit more loud.” ___ AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports Advertisement","pubDate":"2023-07-09 20:57:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"winnipegfreepress","category":["world"],"country":["canada"],"language":"english"},{"title":"New Zealand onion industry welcomes signing of the NZ-EU free trade agreement - Horticulture New Zealand","link":"http://www.voxy.co.nz/national/5/419110","keywords":["National"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The New Zealand onion industry welcomes the signing of the free trade agreement (FTA) with the European Union (EU) today.

The family left on Saturday afternoon and drove straight through to Sunday evening, eventually arriving at their destination: the Calgary Stampede. “I just thought it was the greatest thing I had ever saw,” said Brown, now 90. “It was something big to me. It’s bigger now, but even then, to a 15-year-old who had never been anyplace, it was just amazing.” The cross-province trip left quite an imprint on Brown, who made it a point to come back again — and then again, and again, and again. Stepping foot on Stampede grounds this Saturday marked 75 years since Brown first visited the festival, with only a handful of years missed through the decades. A lot has changed over those 75 years, both for the Stampede and for him. Many Stampede staples, like pancake breakfasts, the parade and the rodeo have existed since the 1940s, but other elements like the busy midway and events programming grew alongside the Stampede’s rapid expansion as Calgary’s population ballooned post-war. To give a sense of the magnitude of growth, the Stampede’s attendance was 267,420 in 1944, compared to 1,216,859 in 2022. And while Brown, who spent his life as a cattle farmer, continued his annual pilgrimage to the Stampede from Manitoba, he went from attending with his father to going with kids and grandkids of his own. It’s a story his daughter Alana McLeod marvels at. “I’m just amazed that he’s still coming. He’s 90 years old and he’s determined to come here,” McLeod said. On this year’s Stampede itinerary for Brown and his family were the chuckwagon races and the , with plans to watch the fireworks to cap off the evening.

To continue reading, please subscribe: + GST for 9 weeks of unlimited access* MEXICO CITY (AP) — Porfirio Muñoz Ledo, Mexico’s veteran political chameleon who played a key role in the country’s democratic reforms, has died at age 89, his family announced Sunday. His relatives did not give a cause of death, but he had been in ill health for some time. Since entering politics in the 1970s, Muñoz Ledo was never far from the center of power, even if that meant changing parties. Tributes poured in from most of Mexico’s political parties; he had belonged to most of them at some point. And many of the tributes began with phrases like “despite our differences,” because Muñoz Ledo eventually broke with all of them. A brilliant strategist, Muñoz Ledo was able to conceive of many possible paths in Mexico’s long transition to democracy. But he was never able to imagine one without himself in a central role. In a 2020 interview with The Associated Press, Muñoz Ledo joked about his own mortality. Asked if he represented the “living history” of Mexican politics, the husky-voiced political pro answered, “I’m about to become dead history.” “I am dedicating all my experience and history to democratizing this country,” he said. “That is the last legacy I have.” President Andrés Manuel López Obrador wrote in his Twitter account, “I regret the passing of Porfirio Muñoz Ledo, who I agreed with for a long time. The recent disagreements don’t erase the long, good moments of friendship and comradery.” On the other end of the political spectrum, former president Felipe Calderón — López Obrador’s arch-nemesis — wrote: “I heard about the death of P. Muñoz Ledo. Despite our differences, we worked together in the opposition” to pass electoral reforms. Those reforms eventually made elections fair enough so that the opposition could unseat the long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party in 2000. The PRI, as the party is known, had held Mexico’s presidency for 70 uninterrupted years at that point. Muñoz Ledo started his career in the PRI in the 1970s, but broke with the party in 1988 to support the presidential candidacy of leftist Cuauhtémoc Cardenas. Cardenas lost in a fraud-filled election. Muñoz Ledo then became a leading member of Cardenas’ Democratic Revolution Party. But in 2000, he ran for the presidency of the now-defunct Authentic Revolution Party. In another switch, he abandoned his campaign midway in 2000 to endorse — and campaign for — ex-president Vicente Fox of the conservative National Action Party. Despite the ideological differences, Muñoz Ledo sensed that Fox’s plainspoken charisma could finally oust the PRI from power. Despite working on government reform during the Fox administration, Muñoz Ledo — who had held diplomatic and Cabinet posts before, and would later go on to serve in Congress — quickly broke with Fox, too. By 2008, he was in the Labor Party, but was already eyeing López Obrador as the next charismatic leader for Mexico. It was with López Obrador’s Morena party that Muñoz Ledo played his last big political role, as leader of Morena in the lower house of Congress. True to form, Muñoz Ledo broke with López Obrador in 2022. “The current government is cheap populism, and violates the rule of law,” Muñoz Ledo said at the time. No funeral plans have yet been announced.

Any thoughts of adulation from supporters may have to be put on hold, if United legend Paul Scholes' previous comments are anything to go by. Scholes warned that any club with billionaire owners, including rivals Manchester City, Arsenal, Tottenham and Liverpool, don't enjoy a connection between their owners and fans - meaning Sheikh Jassim and Sir Jim Ratcliffe could now expect things to be the same should they take over United. Read what Scholes said here Next owners could face Man United budget issue Football finance expert, Kieran Maguire, believes the next owner of Manchester United could face some difficulties due to UEFA's Financial Fair Play. Maguire, speaking to Football Insider , has outlined his view that United's transfer kitty may have to stay the same - regardless of who takes over at Old Trafford. United manager Erik ten Hag is working on a budget this summer, with Mason Mount's signature secured but United having to spend their remaining funds wisely ahead of the new season. It has been observed, by Maguire, that United cannot afford for their losses - as per FFP rules - to go above £15million due to the Glazer's lack of investment. That could feasibly be resolved by new owners pumping money in, but UEFA's financial regulations present another potential dilemma. \"If there is a change of ownership at Old Trafford this summer, one way of bolstering the budget is for new owners to invest money into the club, in the form of new equity shares,\" Maguire said. \"That would help to address the Premier League’s profitability and sustainability rules, as it would allow United to spend an additional £90m over three years - on a combination of wages and amortisation. \"For UEFA, it’s slightly more complex. They have recently changed to their new financial sustainability regulations, which allow clubs to only lose €60m (£51m) over a three-year period. Also, we’re effectively moving to a wage cap of 70 per cent of revenues, although admittedly this has not been an issue for United in recent years.\" Follow the MEN's United coverage on TikTok and YouTube , and subscribe to the Manchester is Red podcast","pubDate":"2023-07-09 20:00:00","image_url":"https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article27041716.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-1136172441-1.jpg","source_id":"manchestereveningnews","category":["world"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Regina Sexual Assault Centre seeking funds to continue Moose Jaw outreach","link":"https://leaderpost.com/news/saskatchewan/regina-sexual-assault-centre-seeking-funds-to-continue-moose-jaw-outreach","keywords":["Local News","News","Saskatchewan"],"creator":["Larissa Kurz"],"video_url":null,"description":"\"We're just looking to receive as much support as possible from the community, so we can keep doing what we're doing.\"","content":"Article content The Regina Sexual Assault Centre is asking for community help in its effort to continue offering wraparound trauma supports to clients in need in nearby Moose Jaw.

Prial said hope now lies with a community fundraising effort. “We’re just looking to receive as much support as possible from the community, so we can keep doing what we’re doing,” Prial said. There is no set fundraising goal, just an open call for help. Any donations given will help cover supplementary operational costs like rent for office space, supplies and salaries. There is a search on for other supporting grants, but those options often take time and come with conditional restrictions on use. It can be “difficult” to find the right one, Prail said. “We have to do some digging to find that perfect one that’s going to support us for what we need,” she added. Article content Recommended from Editorial The call for donations is a financial bid for the non-profit, and Prail said the effort also serves as an awareness campaign. “Our office in Moose Jaw is a more recent thing and oftentimes residents don’t even know that we exist, so we would like to take down that barrier, if we can,” she said. According to Statistics Canada, Saskatchewan continues to have among the highest rates of interpersonal violence per capita in Canada, with reported rates higher in rural areas than urban. Prial said this reality means a rising need for mental health supports, to help break the cycle of trauma. Article content Prial described RSAC as “a piece of the puzzle” in Moose Jaw’s trauma services, as they work in tandem with other partners like Family Services and the Moose Jaw Transition House. But RSAC does receive a lot of referrals from those partners for specialized services, like play therapy or eye movement desensitization and reprocessing, or EMDR therapy. “The training that we have to offer, that is the gold-standard therapy for things like sexual violence and trauma, PTSD,” said Prail. “Not too many counsellors are trained in Saskatchewan for that.” Approximately 70 per cent of RSAC’s clients in Moose Jaw are under the age of 16 years old, she added — a notable statistic, as there is significant affect to a child’s development when trauma supports can be provided earlier rather than later. Article content “When they need them most,” Prial said. Approximately one-third of clients on RSAC’s standing wait-list are from Moose Jaw and area, which Prial said shows a need for the city’s sexual-violence based trauma services to continue there. RSAC doesn’t intend to pull services out of Moose Jaw entirely if funding can’t be found, but the non-profit’s scope is limited by its finances, admitted Prial. “We’re very dedicated to our clients, to our communities here in Regina and in Moose Jaw, so we refuse to let this place go under,” she said. “If we were able to receive more funding, then of course things can flower from there and we’d be able to expand our services, expand our capacity,” she expanded. “But right now, we’re just looking to keep our services running.” RSAC is able to accept donations online through their website , or in the form of cheques by mail to the Regina office. lkurz@postmedia.com The news seems to be flying at us faster all the time.

That’s according to the , the province’s police watchdog, which was called in to investigate the incident since the man arrested suffered a serious injury. Early on the morning of Jan. 28, 2019, police received a complaint of a possible impaired driver. The helicopter, Air 1, found a suspect vehicle at 4 a.m., southbound on 97 Street near Yellowhead Trail. Its video camera captured the incident, the footage in infrared with warm objects showing up white and cool objects black. “The driver was driving very fast and dangerously, including braking quickly and spinning out in the middle of the road,” states a June 30 report by Matthew Block, ASIRT’s assistant executive director. “The (vehicle) turned into a residential area and drove through it at approximately 90 km/h.” The vehicle continued toward a service road perpendicular to the street but there was no access from one to the other. At 4:01 a.m. the vehicle struck the curb between the streets so forcefully it became airborne before “driving through the snowbank, driving through both lanes of Yellowhead Trail, and becoming stuck while partially in the median.” Two minutes passed before the car got back underway, “erratically but slowly” around 50 km/h, this time south in the northbound lanes of 107 Street, while damaged from the collision. The vehicle drove through the median to the southbound lanes, back through the median to the northbound lanes, spun out and stopped in the median. When police vehicles close in and pin the car, Air 1’s video picks up the heat signature from its rear tires as the suspect driver was “pressing down the accelerator and trying to escape.” One officer pulled the suspect driver from the car and struck the top of his head with the butt end of his gun, the report stated. The officer then put his boot on the suspect’s head. Block wrote the officer did this to “control and distract him” because he was resisting, noting the ground was covered in ice and compacted snow. Two other officers then began helping with the arrest, one of them making a “kicking motion” toward the suspect. Block stated that while the kick went toward the upper half of the suspect’s body, “although it was not possible to determine where it landed due to the chaotic scene.” The officer would later say he delivered a “brachial stun” to the neck/shoulder area of the suspect, allowing he and his colleagues to control one of his arms, and a second to control the other. The suspect was arrested after a struggle and brought to hospital with what turned out to be two fractures to bones in the left side of his face near his eye. He was also treated for “diabetic issues.” The suspect told police he was driving near Jasper Avenue and 90 Street that early January morning when he started to feel ill and assumed his blood sugar was dropping. He said he remembers nothing between deciding to drive home and being surrounded by police on the 107 Street median. He remembers an officer standing on his face, and that it felt to him like a dream or a game. Block determined that there wasn’t enough evidence to determine if the officer kicked the suspect in the face, which would have been unjustifiable. But he said the butt-end and the use of a boot to control the suspect’s head were at the “high end of acceptable force. “More care should have been given by the officers around uses of force to the head area of the (suspect).”","pubDate":"2023-07-09 19:45:16","image_url":null,"source_id":"calgaryherald","category":["politics","world"],"country":["canada"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Police make arrests at Llanelli hotel planned to host asylum seekers","link":"https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/police-make-arrests-llanelli-hotel-27288359","keywords":["News"],"creator":["newsdesk@walesonline.co.uk (Ben Summer)"],"video_url":null,"description":"There were more protests outside the hotel on Sunday","content":"Two arrests have been made following protests at Llanelli's Stradey Park Hotel, where the Home Office plans to house 241 asylum seekers.

(AP) — A former Catholic priest in Louisiana has been sentenced to 25 years in prison after he pleaded guilty to drugging and molesting 17 men he met in a popular tourist area in New Orleans, a prosecutor said. WVUE-TV reported that Stephen Sauer, 61, targeted people in the city’s French Quarter who appeared drunk, lost or in need of help, according to Jefferson Parish District Attorney Paul D. Connick Jr. The crimes occurred from 2019 to 2021, and many of the victims were visiting from out of state, Connick said. The investigation began in 2021 after Sauer sent a computer to an electronics repair company in New York. A technician found hundreds of images suggesting sexual assaults had occurred. New York law enforcement officials determined the images were taken in Metairie and notified the Jefferson Parish sheriff. The prosecutor said Sauer put narcotics in men’s drinks at bars or gave them sleep-inducing drugs after they passed out from drinking. He then drove the victims to his home in the New Orleans suburb of Metairie, where he photographed or videotaped the unconscious men and molested some of them. The Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office found during its investigation that Sauer shared the images with others through a website or by email. Sauer was sentenced Friday after he pleaded guilty to 13 counts of sexual battery, nine counts of third-degree rape, 17 counts of video voyeurism and 16 misdemeanor charges of possessing drugs without prescriptions and possession of drug paraphernalia. Judge Shayna Beevers Morvant gave Sauer the 25-year sentence, ordered him to register as a sex offender and banned him from contacting 12 of the victims. Detectives identified many victims because Sauer took photographs of their driver’s licenses or other forms of identification, Connick said.

The new jackpot for Monday’s drawing is the ninth-highest in the history of the game. The Powerball jackpot rolled over after no one matched all six numbers drawn — white balls 7, 23, 24, 32, 43 and red Powerball 18, Powerball officials said Sunday. The Power Play multiplier was 2X. No one has won Powerball since April 19, when a ticket in Ohio brought a prize of $252.6 million. There have been 34 straight drawings without a jackpot winner. The game’s abysmal odds of 1 in 292.2 million are designed to build big prizes that draw more players. The all-time largest Powerball jackpot was $2.04 billion Powerball last November. The $650 million jackpot is for winners who opt for an annuity, paid over 29 years. Most winners prefer cash, which for Monday night’s drawing would be $328.3 million. Powerball is played in 45 states, as well as Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

The latest Briefing from the Public Health Communication Centre details the results of testing on public transport from April to June. The research measured carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in air as a marker for poor ventilation. When more than half of the seats were occupied, poor ventilation was recorded 94% of the time on buses and 77% on trains. These results show that passengers in these buses and trains are doing a lot of re-breathing of other people’s exhaled air. There was also a clear pattern of increasingly poor ventilation as seats got filled up and especially if passengers were also standing in aisles of buses. Lead author, University of Otago Professor Nick Wilson says he was a little surprised by how high some of the results were. \"They were up to eight times background levels (eg 3440 parts per million [ppm] of CO2 in a crowded bus vs outdoor air at 417 ppm). But even so these findings were generally similar to other New Zealand research and international studies in public transport settings.\" Professor Nick Wilson says research around Covid-19 has led to a more sophisticated understanding about ventilation and how it can help protect us from airborne viruses. \"We need to take advantage of that knowledge and take action to improve ventilation in indoor settings.\" He says there are a series of measures which could lessen the risk including developing a common set of national air quality standards for public transport. \"These have been suggested to the Government by the Wellington public transport network Metlink and are a very basic requirement for a safer transport system.\" Professor Wilson says transport companies and local and central government also need to be looking at recommendations for improving ventilation, ranging from actions such as opening all bus/train doors at each stop, to improving the built-in ventilation systems on buses and trains. \"There are other big fixes like increasing public transport services so there is less overcrowding, improving walking and cycling infrastructure, varying work start times more to ease the rush hours and allowing working from home. This is a problem that could benefit from a wide range of actions.\" \"We also identified relatively low mask use by passengers in buses and trains during our study - in the 3% to 11% range,\" says Professor Wilson. \"We need government funded studies on public knowledge and attitudes to mask use to inform current day use and for future pandemics. But that should be alongside a concerted effort to improve ventilation on our buses and trains now.\" The researchers say until improvements are made, commuters who want to avoid infections should use masks and even avoid travelling on very crowded public transport. \"Requiring buses and trains to monitor and display continuous indoor CO2 readings on screens could help passengers make informed decisions about when to wear masks and the timing of their travel.\"","pubDate":"2023-07-09 18:53:25","image_url":null,"source_id":"voxy","category":["world"],"country":["new zealand"],"language":"english"},{"title":"The best photos as thousands of people run the Race for Life in Cardiff on Sunday","link":"https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/gallery/best-photos-thousands-people-run-27287869","keywords":["News"],"creator":["newsdesk@walesonline.co.uk (Ben Summer)"],"video_url":null,"description":"See if you can spot your family and friends running the race","content":"More than 2,600 people arrived in Cardiff to raise money for Cancer Research UK in the 3k, 5k and 10k Race for Life events on Sunday.

After working under former SNP Leader Alex Salmond from 2004, she eventually rose to party leader by 2014. Speaking of her resignation, Sturgeon said it was the right time to go and the decision was clear “in my head and heart” after finding the intensity of politics unbearable. Following the Gender Recognition Reform Bill which Sturgeon backed in order to ‘modernise gender recognition’, critics slammed her as it was denounced as an affront to women’s rights. The Independent reports that she denied the gender identification row (and controversy of the incarceration of biological male rapists in women’s prison) was the “straw that broke the camel’s back”. That said, some rallied together to celebrate Sturgeon’s legacy like Lorraine Kelly who called her a “brilliant politician” or Anas Sarwar saying her work was “worthy of respect and thanks.” What’s clear from responses is that Sturgeon has also sparked great controversy during her premiership as some responses reveal in the following fourteen quotes from political figures. 1 . Alex Salmond (Alba Party Leader) \"There has been no question of Nicola’s talents as a first-rate political communicator and election winner and – having been there – I feel for her personally on the day of her resignation... There are two questions for the future. One is that the movement has been left with no clear strategy for independence. The previously accepted referendum route has been closed and the de facto referendum/election proposal is now, at best, up in the air. Secondly there is no obvious successor.\" Photo: Submitted 2 .

(AP) — Florida prosecutors seeking the death penalty for a plastic surgeon accused of killing a lawyer and dumping his body in the Everglades have laid out their case in new court filings. Authorities say Dr. Tomasz Kosowski killed attorney Steven Cozzi in the bathroom of Cozzi’s law office moments after both participated in a March 21 conference call about a lengthy, acrimonious legal battle over medical billing. Prosecutors said in court documents that Kosowski took the call from a Toyota pickup truck outside the office and that he had supplies to commit the killing, including trash bags, a syringe containing a paralyzing drug and a wagon to haul the corpse out. Although Cozzi’s body has never been found, investigators used cellphone records and surveillance video to track Kosowski to a remote area west of Miami on the Tamiami Trail, also known as U.S. Highway 41. That’s where they believe Kosowski tossed the body into a Dumpster that was eventually emptied by a garbage truck. The driver noticed an unusually “vile” smell at the stop, authorities said. “Video from the garbage truck of the Dumpster being emptied into the garbage truck shows a large garbage bag falling in a manner inconsistent with normal trash,” prosecutors said in a motion asking a judge to hold Kosowski without bond. The parcel’s shape and the way it fell looked consistent with something that might hold a human body, they said. A police cadaver dog also indicated a body had been in the Dumpster, according to court documents filed Friday. Trash from the route is typically hauled to a Collier County landfill, but authorities who searched the property for Cozzi’s body said the facility routinely compacts its trash, “making recovery efforts nearly impossible.” The new details emerged in court filings ahead of a July 17 hearing in which Kosowski’s lawyers plan to seek his release on bail. In Florida, anyone accused of first-degree murder is generally jailed until trial unless the defense can show a compelling reason they shouldn’t be. Kosowski, 44, has pleaded not guilty. A graduate of Dartmouth College medical school, he has specialized in reconstructive breast surgery for eight years, according to papers filed by his lawyers. They contend the prosecution’s case is flimsy, that Kosowski poses no threat and that their client will not try to evade justice. If released, Kosowski plans to stay at his multimillion-dollar waterfront home in Tarpon Springs. The new court documents detail prosecutors’ evidence against Kosowski, including Cozzi’s blood and DNA found in the law office bathroom and in the garage at Kosowski’s home, where it was mixed with the doctor’s DNA. In addition, authorities say Kosowski bought the Toyota truck with cash weeks before Cozzi’s slaying and never registered the vehicle, which had a license plate flipping device that allowed tags to be substituted with the touch of a button. One of the license plates associated with it was registered to a dead person. When Kosowski was arrested March 25, investigators said he had $280,000 in cash, masks, duct tape, firearms, a ballistic vest with “EMS” written on it, law enforcement patches and a vial of succinylcholine, which is a paralyzing drug. A search of his home turned up about 200 guns, according to court documents. Cozzi, meanwhile, seemingly disappeared without a trace. His keys, wallet and cellphone remained on his law office desk and a work file was open on his computer. His husband has not heard from him. The missing lawyer represented a Dunedin, Florida-based medical practice that Kosowski alleged shorted him thousands of dollars in billings and damaged his reputation as a doctor. The dispute got so heated that Kosowski tried to get Cozzi removed from the case and at one point allegedly called Cozzi a “scumbag” during an encounter in the same law office bathroom where prosecutors say the attorney was slain.

The court in the town of Bindura upheld Friday’s police order that the opposition Citizens Coalition for Change party could not hold the rally to officially launch its election campaign because the venue was unsuitable. The CCC had appealed in court against the order. The decision increased tensions in the southern African nation, which has a history of violent and disputed elections. The CCC immediately criticized the move as more evidence of a push by President Emmerson Mnangagwa and his ruling ZANU-PF party to silence the opposition using the police and the courts. Mnangagwa, 80, replaced long-ruling autocrat Robert Mugabe in a coup in 2017. He promised a new era of freedom and prosperity for Zimbabweans, who had seen their country’s economy crumble amid some of the highest inflation rates ever seen. But Mnangagwa has turned out to be as repressive as his predecessor, say critics, and the economy continues to collapse. There has been a crackdown on any kind of criticism. The yellow-clad CCC supporters who gathered outside Bindura Magistrates Court sang “Dictatorship remains. When will this country be free?” Police said that the opposition party’s chosen venue for Sunday’s rally was unsuitable because it was a “bushy” area with poor access via road, raising safety concerns for those attending. The police also said there was a “high risk” of the spread of communicable diseases. A rally where thousands of ruling party supporters packed tightly together in a stadium to hear Mnangagwa speak was allowed to go ahead on Saturday. “We are getting into a match with both legs tied,” said CCC lawyer Agency Gumbo. “They would rather keep the opposition at the courts than on the campaign trail.” There was “an uneven playing ground that shows that the democratic process has been corroded,” Gumbo said. The CCC initially appealed against the police order at the High Court in the capital, Harare on Saturday. The case was moved to the court in Bindura, where the rally was scheduled to take place. The Bindura court eventually ruled late afternoon on Sunday, hours after the rally was meant to start at 10 a.m. The CCC says the repression in the buildup to the Aug. 23 elections has included violence and intimidation against its supporters, the arrest of its officials and bans on its meetings. The opposition has also raised concerns over alleged voters’ roll irregularities ahead of elections that will decide the presidency but also the makeup of the Parliament and nearly 2,000 local government positions. Mnangagwa and his administration have denied the allegations of intimidation, with the president recently describing Zimbabwe as “a mature democracy.” CCC leader Nelson Chamisa lost narrowly to Mnangwagwa in the 2018 presidential election and had his claim of vote-rigging rejected by the Constitutional Court. Mnangagwa and the 45-year-old Chamisa are two of 11 candidates who have registered to stand in next month’s presidential election. ___ More AP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa Advertisement","pubDate":"2023-07-09 18:01:54","image_url":null,"source_id":"winnipegfreepress","category":["world"],"country":["canada"],"language":"english"},{"title":"KAIPTC is Centre of reference in Peace and Security – AU Commission","link":"https://newsghana.com.gh/kaiptc-is-centre-of-reference-in-peace-and-security-au-commission/","keywords":["Inside Africa","AU Commission","GNA","James Amoh Junior","KAIPTC AU-Commission","KAIPTC is the Centre of reference in Peace and Security","politics"],"creator":["GNA"],"video_url":null,"description":"News Ghana, Latest Updates and Breaking News of Ghana, GNA, https://newsghana.com.gh/kaiptc-is-centre-of-reference-in-peace-and-security-au-commission/Madam Mme Bineta Diop, Special Envoy of the Chairperson of the African Union Commission on Women, Peace and Security, says the Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Training Centre is the Centre of Excellence in Africa. “KAIPTC is the number one Centre of Excellence in Africa that is recognized by the African Union Commission and globally in […] News Ghana, Latest Updates and Breaking News of Ghana, GNA, https://newsghana.com.gh/kaiptc-is-centre-of-reference-in-peace-and-security-au-commission/","content":"Madam Mme Bineta Diop, Special Envoy of the Chairperson of the African Union Commission on Women, Peace and Security, says the Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Training Centre is the Centre of Excellence in Africa. “KAIPTC is the number one Centre of Excellence in Africa that is recognized by the African Union Commission and globally in terms of the work the Centre does in peace and security but in particular women peace and security,” she said. Madam Diop made the remarks when the Executive Management Committee of KAIPTC paid a courtesy call on the Commission in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, as part of a collaborative visit to key stakeholders of the Centre. “You are our Centre of reference, and that is why since I took office at the African Union, my first training was with KAIPTC in Accra, Ghana,” she emphasized. She said women played critical roles in the peace and security architecture and that their involvement in conflict prevention, peace negotiations, and post-conflict reconstruction should not be underestimated. Therefore, she commended the KAIPTC for its immense contribution to the gender mainstreaming and reinforcing the women, peace, and security agenda in Africa. She reiterated the Commission’s commitment to work closely with the Centre, saying, “we will continue to work with you to get more skills on the women’s perspectives in peace and security. You have the knowledge, expertise, and commitment.” Major General Richard Addo Gyane, Commandant, KAIPTC, who led the delegation, said, among others, the visit was to deepen cooperation, collaboration, and enhance engagement with the African Union Commission. He said in the next phase of the Centre, the issues of women and the youth would be prioritised, and that the Women, Peace and Security Unit of the Centre would be upgraded to a department, with the inclusion of a youth component. The Commandant said the empowerment of women and the youth in all peace and security processes was crucial for achieving sustainable peace and security in Africa. Ms. Horname Noagbesenu, Director, Policy Planning Monitoring and Evaluation Department (PPMED), KAIPTC, speaking on the Centre’s strategic plan for 2024 to 2028, stated that, conversations, engagements and consultations with key partners had already began to consider very critical issues and emerging trends to inform the Centre’s strategy in the next five years. She reiterated that considering the commitments the Centre placed on issues of Women, Peace and Security, the first approach was to elevate the Unit into a department to emphasized the critical concerns among women and the youth in peacebuilding processes. In the last five years, Ms. Horname said, the Centre’s work had been focused on peace and security, adding that one of the areas it had worked on closely was the Continental Results Framework, which an evaluation had proved its importance as one of the major programmes the Centre had run on women, peace and security. “This is great especially now that proceeds are being seen, knowing that various member states are actually developing and pulling together data to be able to support the implementation of the National Action Plans among others,” the Director of Policy Planning Monitoring and Evaluation said. “That is a big plus for us. However, we can not say that we did this by ourselves, but partnership with the AUC Office of the Special Envoy on Women Peace and Security was key,” she noted. Moving forward in terms of the strategy, Ms. Horname said that issues around gender-based violence would be critically considered, adding that, while a lot of work had been undertaken in the area, there was still a lot of work to be done. Another area of emphasis, she said, was the implementation of the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and People’s Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa (Maputo Protocol), which remains one of the most progressive legal instruments providing a comprehensive set of human rights for African women. She said it was important to look at the gains chalked over the last 20 years and better utilize the instrument as a means to further actualize the rights of African women for the next five years. She said, the impact of climate change on women and the effort to bridge the gap between policy and practice to enhance women’s role in society would be key areas of focus for the Centre. The Centre believes this will create synergistic approaches to the realities of women and the youth in our communities and help us contribute to addressing them, she said.","pubDate":"2023-07-09 17:50:47","image_url":null,"source_id":"newsghana","category":["world"],"country":["ghana"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Overdue Book Returned To US Library 119 Years Later","link":"https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/overdue-book-returned-to-us-library-119-years-later-4192277","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The book made its way to a donation pile in West Virginia, nearly 900 miles from its home.","content":"The New Bedford Free Public Library shared the pictures of the returned book on their Facebook page A book on the development of electricity has finally been returned.

A spokesperson for the Federal Aviation Administration, Mina Kaji, told The Press-Enterprise in Riverside, California, that the Cessna C550 business jet took off from Harry Reid International Airport at about 3:15 a.m. Saturday. The plane crashed about an hour later at French Valley Airport in Murrieta, California, about 80 miles (130 kilometers) southeast of Los Angeles. All aboard were killed.

Bianco did not release other details. The crash occurred during the second of two landing attempts in fog just before dawn, authorities said. The jet, which can seat up to 13 people, crashed about 500 feet (150 meters) short of the intended runway, said Elliott Simpson, an investigator with the National Transportation Safety Board. Simpson said fire consumed most of the plane.

Democrats and Republicans were split, with members of both parties siding with and against Biden’s decision. Those against mainly cited the threat the weapons pose on civilian’s safety. The Biden administration last week that it planned to provide Ukraine with cluster munitions, which contain multiple explosive submunitions and are by many countries due to the risks. Biden has his decision, saying in an interview with CNN that he believes Ukraine “needed them.” He also said that it was a “very difficult decision” made after discussing it with allies and lawmakers. Democrats on Sunday shows appeared be torn on whether to support the cluster bombs. California Rep. Barbara Lee (D) at Biden’s approval of cluster munitions to Ukraine as the country prepares a counteroffensive against Russia’s invasion. “Cluster bombs should never be used. That’s crossing a line,” Lee said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “Once you see what takes place, we know what takes place in terms of cluster bombs being very dangerous to civilians. They don’t always immediately explode. Children can step on them. That’s a line we should not cross,” she added. Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) also about the cluster munitions on Sunday, saying that he has some “real qualms” about the decision. He pointed to a 2008 treaty signed by 123 countries that pledged not to use cluster munition weapons in war, but the U.S., Russia and Ukraine are not signatories on the treaty. He did offer some praise for the Biden administration’s agreement with Ukraine so it will use them “in a way to dislodge Russian military while minimizing risks to Ukrainian civilians.” “I would still say, though, I have some real qualms about it,” he told anchor Shannon Bream on “Fox News Sunday.” “When there’s an international prohibition, and the U.S. says, ‘But here’s a good reason to do something different,’ it could give a green light to other nations to do something different as well.” Democratic Sen. Chris Coons (Del.) said Sunday that he to send the weapons to Ukraine, adding that the country was burning through artillery munitions “at a remarkable rate.” He also said that the Ukrainians “are at risk of losing this counter offensive if they run out of their shells,” which is why he backed the decision. “It’s the Ukrainians who are asking to be able to use these on their own soil. They’ve committed to monitoring their use, to remediating them after the war. And frankly, they will be tactically helpful against dug-in Russian troops that are behind large mine fields. So, weighing all of those factors, the president made a tough call that I will support,” Coons said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul (R-Texas), meanwhile, said Sunday that he sees no wrong in sending cluster munitions to Ukraine, noting that they could actually be a in its efforts against the Russia invasion. McCaul has been a frequent critic of what he sees as the Biden administration moving to slow to provide Ukraine with military weaponry. “They want these as self-defense to use against Russians in their own country of Ukraine. I don’t see anything wrong with that because, quite honestly, … as you look at the counteroffensive, it’s been slowed tremendously because this administration has been so slow to get the weapons in,” McCaul said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”","pubDate":"2023-07-09 17:40:09","image_url":"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/07/cluster-munitions-2.png?w=900","source_id":"thehill","category":["world"],"country":["united states of america"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Italy agrees to lift ban on flights from conflict-stricken Libya, officials say","link":"https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/world/2023/07/09/italy-agrees-to-lift-ban-on-flights-from-conflict-stricken-libya-officials-say","keywords":["World"],"creator":["Feedloaderapi"],"video_url":null,"description":"CAIRO (AP) — Commercial flights between Italy and conflict-torn Libya will resume in September after the Italian government agreed to lift a 10-year-long ban on civil aviation in the North […]","content":"CAIRO (AP) — Commercial flights between Italy and conflict-torn Libya will resume in September after the Italian government agreed to lift a 10-year-long ban on civil aviation in the North African nation, one of Libya’s rival governments said Sunday.

Abdul-Hamid Dbeibah, prime minister of the Tripoli-based government, said on Twitter that the Italian government of Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni informed his government of the decision. He called the removal of the ban a “breakthrough.” The decision came after Libyan and Italian aviation officials met Sunday in the Libyan capital of Tripoli to discuss “the upcoming restoration of direct flights and the strengthening of cooperation” between the two countries, according to a statement from the Italian Embassy in Libya. Oil-rich Libya plunged into chaos after a NATO-backed uprising toppled and killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi in 2011. In the disarray that followed, the country split into rival administrations in the east and west, each backed by rogue militias and foreign governments. Italy and other European countries banned Libyan flights from their airspace as the country descended into chaos. Over the past decade, Libya has had direct flights to limited destinations, including cities in neighboring Egypt and Tunisia, and other Middle Eastern countries, such as Jordan. A Libyan government statement said the two countries have agreed that one airliner from each country would operate flights starting in September. They did not name the destination cities.

In her four days in the Chinese capital, Yellen met with the main economic policy makers of the Asian country, including the Prime Minister, li qiang ; the new head of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) at the People’s Bank, pan gongsheng ; to the finance minister, liu kun or the deputy prime minister He Lifeng . In all the interactions, described by both as “frank and productive”, the two sides emphasized the need to “avoid misunderstandings” and try to direct their battered relationship, for which they called on to continue maintaining “dialogue and exchanges”, if Well both Yellen and Chinese officials acknowledged that there are wide disagreements. The Chinese side bluntly expressed its concerns “over the US sanctions and its restrictive measures against China”, while Yellen criticized Beijing’s “unfair practices”, citing, among others, “existing barriers to access their markets”, and clarified that Washington will continue to take “specific measures for reasons of national security.” At the negotiating table, they planned the restrictions that the US imposed last year on the export of US-made semiconductors and materials, a measure called to limit Beijing’s ability to manufacture parts necessary for the operation of supercomputers or advanced military systems. Restrictions to which others could be added to exports of artificial intelligence chips to China, according to the US press, to which Beijing responded this week with limitations on the export of gallium and germanium, two key metals for the manufacture of semiconductors, a product that is at the center of commercial and technological tensions between the two. “Abusing the concept of national security is something that the only thing it achieves is damaging economic and commercial exchanges,” accused the Chinese state agency Xinhua after the meeting on Saturday between Yellen and He, evidencing the disagreements. The Secretary of the Treasury, for her part, also brought to the fore the latest “punitive measures against US firms” in reference to the investigations launched in China against several American consultancies or the prohibition of the American technology company Micron from selling products to Chinese clients. The Chinese press stressed this Sunday that “it is the United States that must work with China” so that relations return “to the right path”, although they acknowledge that US officials are making “efforts” to improve contacts. “It is a positive sign for the world, which urgently needs the two great global economic powers to talk and cooperate in the face of ever greater challenges. But it is necessary for Washington to be true to its words,” comments the official Global Times newspaper in this regard. an editorial. According to the academic gao lingyun from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the economic relations between the two “served for a long time as a stabilizing factor”, but the problem now is that the two powers compete at the same time that they show their dependence, which makes it so difficult to reach agreements “significant”. Yellen herself acknowledged that the US “does not seek to economically disassociate itself from China” because that would be “disastrous” and “destabilizing” for both: “Seeing the two parties sitting at the table is good in itself. But for the United States to sanction While China expresses ‘concerns’, it is somewhat exaggerated. It only serves to justify their measures, which are aimed at damaging China’s development,” Gao denounces. And while Yellen asked to compete, but “under some rules”, Vice Premier He confessed that the Chinese side regrets the “unexpected incidents that damaged ties in recent months”, in apparent reference to the episode of the alleged Chinese “spy” balloon that flew over the United States at the end of January and fell over Atlantic waters on February 4. That episode seemed to destroy the rapprochement between the presidents of both countries, Joe Biden and Xi Jinping during their meeting in November 2022 on the sidelines of the G-20 summit in Bali. Thus, Yellen’s visit followed the one made in June by the Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken who also emphasized “the importance of keeping communication channels open in all areas to reduce the risk of miscalculation” in an attempt to reduce tension between the two powers and prevent competition from leading to open conflict.","pubDate":"2023-07-09 17:33:39","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenewsglory","category":["world"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Data sharing deal between Alberta and Statistics Canada remains elusive after 7 years","link":"http://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/data-sharing-deal-between-alberta-and-statistics-canada-remains-elusive-after-7-years/wcm/9cc2594e-9ab5-45ae-8a4b-13e046568368","keywords":["Local News"],"creator":["Ari Yanover"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"The Alberta government and Statistics Canada remain at odds over the province’s sharing of driver’s licence data in what has become a more than seven-year delay that follows multiple requests from the federal statistics agency. The request is by Statistics Canada, who is seeking the data under the Statistics Act for census purposes, citing difficulties with data collection during the COVID-19 pandemic. “Obtaining an accurate and comprehensive list of all dwellings is necessary for achieving full census coverage,” its website reads. “A key COVID-19 adaptation of the 2021 census is to limit the amount of door-to-door census visits, and therefore addresses become more important in order to mail census invitation letters.” In an email to Postmedia, the agency notes the records “have long been provided by provinces” but that it has been seeking Alberta’s data since 2016. “These data ensure we have contact information for residents and that the population counts and characteristics upon which government programs rely, don’t miss groups or areas,” it reads, adding the information is needed to “accurately represent all Canadians.” It says rural areas are particularly under-represented in census gathering, and data from licences could be used “where the quality of the available administrative data is deemed acceptable.” Statistics Canada filed another request for the information in May of 2021, seeking “monthly data on an ongoing basis.” A spokesperson for Service Alberta said the ministry is working with Statistics Canada on its application for the data, but to date no information has been shared. “A number of steps must be taken to ensure the protection of Albertan’s motor vehicle information before any data can be shared.” The ministry also noted, “should the government proceed with the application, our Ministry is compelled to put out a notice of public disclosure to Albertans so they clearly understand where their information is going and for what purpose.” The Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner told Postmedia it is not aware of any recent discussions on the matter. The data Statistics Canada is seeking includes names, sex, dates of birth, and addresses. The information was first requested in May 2016, and again in 2020 when Statistics Canada gave the Alberta government a Sept. 1, 2020 deadline ahead of 2021 census. A September 2020 briefing note for chief statistician of Canada, Anil Arora, outlines the nature of at least three prior failed attempts to get the information. “Statistics Canada attempted to engage numerous officials, ministers, and deputy ministers, with no success,” it reads. “Multiple administrative and legal delays within the Government of Alberta, including a change in government and changes to departmental structures and personnel, prevented the fulfilment of this request.” In November of 2021, Statistics Canada told that “we are well on our way to a successful agreement,” though that deal remains elusive nearly three years later. At the time, Service Alberta blamed an update to “the motor vehicles system” for the delay. The next census is scheduled for 2026.

Sure, her parents and coaches have played huge roles in helping her become the latest teen sensation in tennis. But Andreeva knows herself better than anyone else does, so the conversation after this year’s French Open stayed internal. “Honestly, after Paris I just had quite a long talk with myself, just me and myself, and that’s it. I talked to myself. I just talked,” Andreeva said. “I don’t know, just in my head I realized some things. I took some decisions that I think are now important for me.” In her second major tournament, Andreeva has already done one better, advancing to the fourth round at Wimbledon following a 6-2, 7-5 victory over 22nd-seeded Anastasia Potapova on No. 3 Court. “I did a good job because now everything is working so far,” said the Russian teen who trains in France. “Yes, I just talked with myself, and I decided everything what I have to do next. So far it’s working.” Andreeva became the youngest player to reach the fourth round at Wimbledon since Coco Gauff in 2019. She will next face will No. 25 Madison Keys for a spot in the quarterfinals. Pretty heavy stuff for a teenager who is being touted as a potential superstar on the tennis circuit. “Actually, I think I’m just a normal teenager, like normal girl. I do, I think, everything that the girls my age do. I love to watch some series. I have to do my school. I have no choice. I have to suffer for two more years, and that’s it,” Andreeva said, smiling at that last part. “Sometimes it depends on my mood, but sometimes I prefer to be alone, just with myself, yes.” For such a young player, her maturity came through on court. After winning the first set on Sunday, she found herself trailing 4-1 in the second. Keeping her cool, she was able to regroup and take back control. “Today, honestly, even if I wanted to show some emotions, I honestly, I couldn’t because I was out of breath almost every point,” Andreeva said in an on-court interview. “I really couldn’t show any emotions.” Fridays The Free Press sports editor keeps you up to date on all that’s happening on the ice, the field, the court, and places in between. They came out after, though, when she sat in her chair and pulled her purple Wimbledon towel up over her face for a few seconds to regain her composure. The pressure at the oldest Grand Slam tournament will only intensify. After six straight victories in her only six times playing on grass — three in qualifying and three in the main draw — Andreeva is now looking to emulate 2021 U.S. Open champion Emma Raducanu and become only the second qualifier in history to win a major tournament. “Of course, in 2021 she did amazing job. Everyone was impressed,” Andreeva said of Raducanu, a British player who is missing Wimbledon this year because of injuries. “But me, I just try to not think about it. I think it will disturb me, all these thoughts. I just try to play every match and don’t think how far I have gone already or which round I’m playing, against who I’m playing.” ___ AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports Advertisement","pubDate":"2023-07-09 17:29:30","image_url":null,"source_id":"winnipegfreepress","category":["world"],"country":["canada"],"language":"english"},{"title":"China and the US, still adversaries, are talking.

After 10 hours of meetings over two days in Beijing, Yellen said at a news conference on Sunday that she believed the United States and China were on a steadier footing despite their “significant disagreements.” “We believe that the world is big enough for both of our countries to thrive,” Yellen said. Yellen announced that the two sides would pursue more frequent communication at the highest levels, describing improved dialogue as a way to prevent mistrust from building and fraying a relationship that she called “one of the most consequential of our time.” Her trip followed one a few weeks by Secretary of State Antony Blinken. And later this month, John Kerry, the special presidential envoy for climate change, will visit China to restart global warming negotiations. Yet a meaningful easing of the economic tension may not be likely. Yellen headed back to Washington on Sunday with no announcements of breakthroughs or agreements to mend the persistent fissures between the two nations. And Yellen made clear that the Biden administration has serious concerns about many of China’s commercial practices, including its treatment of foreign companies, and policies that the United States views as efforts at economic coercion.

Hours before Yellen’s news conference, China’s official news agency, Xinhua, issued a report on her visit that described the talks as constructive but also reiterated what China sees as key areas of dispute. The report expressed China’s continued objections to the Biden administration’s emphasis on preserving U.S. national security through trade restrictions. “China believes that generalizing national security is not conducive to normal economic and trade exchanges,” Xinhua said. “The Chinese side expressed concern about U.S. sanctions and restrictive measures against China.” The U.S.-China relationship is enormously consequential. Their economies, the world’s two largest, together represent 40% of global output and remain integral partners in many ways. They sell and buy critical products from each other, finance each other’s businesses, and create apps and movies for audiences in both countries. Chinese officials raised their own concerns with Yellen. The Treasury secretary said they discussed the tariffs that the Trump administration imposed on Chinese imports, which have been left in place. While Yellen has criticized tariffs as ineffective, she suggested that the administration would not make any decision about the levies until an ongoing internal review of them was concluded, reiterating the position of the administration since President Joe Biden took office. She also acknowledged Chinese concerns about looming U.S. restrictions on investment in China and said that she tried to explain that such measures would be narrowly targeted at certain sectors and would not be intended to have broad effects on China’s economy. Chinese officials and experts also worry that the administration’s efforts to limit China’s access to certain technology could impair their development of high-potential industries such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing. China has had its own broader restrictions on outbound investment since 2016, as it has encouraged Chinese companies and households to steer clear of overseas real estate speculation and has pushed them instead to invest abroad in sectors of strategic value such as aircraft production, heavy manufacturing and cybersecurity. Wu Xinbo, dean of international studies at Fudan University in Shanghai, cautioned that Yellen’s trip would not result in a substantive improvement in relations unless it was accompanied by changes in the Biden administration’s policies toward China. “So far, we haven’t seen any sign that Biden will rethink his economic policy toward China,” he said. The desire for more dialogue struck some analysts as a significant development, with both countries at least talking about their disagreements after months of silence. He Weiwen, a former official at China’s Ministry of Commerce who is now a senior fellow at the Center for China and Globalization in Beijing, welcomed Yellen’s comment that both China and the United States could thrive. “China and the U.S. have profound differences, so constant, direct exchanges are not only constructive but of crucial importance,” he said. Chinese economic policymakers have a long history of working more closely with the Treasury Department, which has historically valued China as a sizable investor in U.S. bonds and as a potential market for American financial services. The Commerce Department and the Office of the United States Trade Representative, with their greater emphasis on fostering employment and industrial self-reliance, have tended to have more fractious relationships with their Chinese counterparts. This was particularly true during the Trump administration. Liu He, who was the vice premier overseeing international economic policy until He Lifeng succeeded him four months ago, tried repeatedly to reach compromises on trade and economic matters with Steven Mnuchin, who served as Treasury Secretary under former President Donald Trump. But Mnuchin was unable to persuade Trump, who ended up imposing tariffs on a wide range of Chinese exports as retaliation for what he said were unfair business practices. Many U.S. businesses with ties to China, along with Chinese officials, had hoped for friendlier relations under Biden. Instead, tensions between the U.S. and China have grown deeper over the past two years and became downright frosty after the spy balloon episode in February. While Yellen’s visit was seen as a positive step, many experts in both China and the United States cautioned against expecting a lot to change. “Yellen’s trip will likely turn down the temperature on the economic relationship for a bit and remind the U.S. and China that they share some commercial interests, even if waning, and they need to talk through thick and thin — perhaps business conditions will improve at the margins,” said Mark Sobel, a former longtime Treasury official. But given national security concerns in both countries, a perception in China that the U.S. seeks to contain its economic advancement and hawkish political language on both sides, he said, “Yellen’s trip will hardly change the underlying dynamic and trajectory of the economic relationship.” Despite the disagreements between the U.S. and China, Yellen was greeted warmly during her first visit to Beijing as Treasury secretary. In a meeting with Li, he mentioned that a rainbow had appeared overhead upon her arrival and suggested it was a symbol of hope that ties between the two countries could be mended. After Yellen was spotted dining on Thursday night at a restaurant that serves cuisine from the province of Yunnan, Chinese state media wrote about her impressive use of chopsticks and reported that bookings at the restaurant were up after she was seen eating mushroom dishes on social media. Yellen also met with Chinese experts on climate finance and had lunch with a group of Chinese women who are economists and entrepreneurs. She suggested that there are many areas where the United States and China can find agreement. “Our people share many things in common — far more than our differences,” Yellen said at the lunch.

The gunmen arrived at the Akpuuna village in Benue state’s Ukum district on Saturday, shooting dead the villagers before escaping the area, according to Tersoo Kula, the spokesman for Benue state’s governor. Police blamed the attack on a “militia gang,” a common reference to armed groups in Nigeria’s hard-hit northwest and central regions where armed violence has claimed the lives of thousands in the last year. Catherine Anene, police spokeswoman in Benue, said eight bodies were retrieved from the scene. Local officials, including legislator Ezra Nyiyongo, said there were at least 24 killed and several others injured. “I lack words to express my shock and sympathy to the families of the lost ones,” said Nyiyongo as he published the names of those killed. Benue Gov. Hyacinth Iormem Alia said the attack was unprovoked and directed security agents to hunt for the suspects, his spokesman Kula said. “Government will do everything possible to put measures in place to checkmate these things and forestall a re-occurrence,” Kalu said. Such attacks are common in many parts of Nigeria’s northern region where local herdsmen have clashed in the past with farmers over limited access to land and water. More than 100 people have been killed this year in the violence in Benue alone. Arrests are rare after the killings. The gunmen in the latest incident operated for more than two hours without the intervention of security forces, according to Emmanuel Udende, who represents the village at the Nigerian Senate. His comment re-echoed concerns about the security of villagers in many violent hotspots where the Nigerian security forces are far outnumbered and outgunned.

The short-lived mutiny led by Wagner mercenary founder Yevgeny Prigozhin in Russia in June has raised about the outlook for his group’s sprawling of military and commercial operations across CAR and other parts of Africa, the Middle East and elsewhere. Reports of the recent departure of large numbers of Wagner personnel from CAR by plane have fuelled speculation in recent days that the group is pulling out of the country, where they have been helping the government to quell several rebel insurgencies since 2018. But CAR presidential spokesperson Albert Yaloke Mokpem said “it is not a definitive departure but a rotation.” “Some have left, and others will come,” he said at a press conference in the capital Bangui. Several hundred Wagner troops have recently left the country, a military source told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity and without giving further details. It is not known how many remain. Some 1,900 Russian mercenaries, including from Wagner, were believed to be operating there. Any restructuring of Wagner operations in CAR could have substantial commercial ramifications. Analysts have said Wagner received logging rights and control of a gold mine in CAR. In June the United States put on a CAR company as one of several including one from the UAE that it said was involved in financing Wagner through illicit gold dealings.","pubDate":"2023-07-09 17:15:06","image_url":null,"source_id":"thezimbabwemail","category":["world"],"country":["Zimbabwe"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Tesco and Home Bargains recall products over safety concerns","link":"https://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/shopping/tesco-home-bargains-recall-products-27286925","keywords":["News"],"creator":["newsdesk@walesonline.co.uk (Conor Gogarty)"],"video_url":null,"description":"Gluten has been found in three Tesco products which were marketed as free from the protein","content":"Tesco is among the retailers to have recalled items in recent days amid health and safety concerns.

Between 22 and 31 people, according to the sources, were killed by bombs in the neighboring city of Omdurman on Saturday, in one of the worst attacks on civilians since the conflict between rival generals began. The country’s army denied being behind the bombing. The Rapid Support Forces (FAR) paramilitary group insisted yesterday to Efe that it has no intention of withdrawing from its positions in Khartoum or any other region of Sudan amid an increase in violence in a conflict that has lasted for almost three months. . António Guterres, Secretary General of the United Nations, warned that Sudan is on the verge of “a full-scale civil war”, as clashes continued yesterday in the capital. The conflict directly threatens not only the balance in the country, which has been shattered, but that of the entire region, as Farhan Haq, spokesman for Guterres, analyzed yesterday. The UN warns of extreme risk and Egypt calls on neighboring countries to study measures Egypt has agreed to host an urgent summit on Thursday to calm things down. All statements and movements warn of a conflict that can reach deep and poisonous roots, especially for the civilian population. Chaos has engulfed Sudan as a result of strong disagreements between chief general Abdel Fattah Burhan and his rival, also general Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, commander of the aforementioned FAR paramilitary group. The confrontation between these two figures has its origin in the alliance that both forged to carry out a coup a year and a half ago, in 2021, and thus overthrow the transitional government supported by the West. The coup cut short the hopes of the population to move towards a democratic model longed for by the population, which had risen up against the long-standing autocrat Omar al Bashir in April 2019. For weeks, the streets of both Khartoum and other cities Sudanese have become battlefields. The Minister of Health, Haitham Mohamed Ibrahim, commented a few days ago that the escalation of violence since mid-April has claimed the lives of more than 3,000 people and injured at least twice as many. The number of fatalities, however, aims to be much higher than officially declared and there is talk of more than 11,000 injuries, according to data handled by the World Health Organization. Nearly three million people (out of a country of 45 million total) have left their homes to seek refuge in safer areas of the country. The fight between two generals has already claimed the lives of at least 3,000 people and injured at least 6,000 “The armed forces clarify that the Air Force did not deal with any hostile targets in Omdurman yesterday,” the army said in a statement a day after rival FAR militias reported the deaths of “more than 31 people.” The situation in the area makes counting difficult. The countries bordering Sudan – Egypt, Libya, Chad, South Sudan, Central African Republic, Ethiopia and Eritrea – will hold a summit on Thursday to discuss “ways to end the conflict” and how to mitigate the “negative impacts” of the war on Sudanese soil, which has sparked a wave of refugees and intensified concerns about insecurity in the region. The meeting has been convened by the Egyptian president, Abdul Fatah al Sisi, in order to “create a common vision for neighboring countries of Sudan.”","pubDate":"2023-07-09 17:08:31","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenewsglory","category":["world"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cost increases from grocery suppliers to supermarkets increase 8.3% in June","link":"http://www.voxy.co.nz/national/5/419100","keywords":["National"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Supplier costs rose again year on year in June, but momentum in the cost increases to supermarkets has continued to moderate compared with 2022.","content":"Supplier costs rose again year on year in June, but momentum in the cost increases to supermarkets has continued to moderate compared with 2022.

Every month, the Index tracks what it costs supermarkets to buy the goods to put on the shelf. Previous analysis shows that supplier costs are the major component of supermarket prices, representing two-thirds of the on-shelf price. \"Input cost indicators continue to show a moderation of further pressure too. Global food prices show an improvement, and increases in imported food costs have moderated since the start of 2023. Domestic food input costs are still showing a trend of rising costs, but at a less intense rate as previously,\" says Mr Olsen. Imported food prices rose by 13%pa in the first quarter of 2023, a slower pace than the 26%pa recorded at the end of 2022. \"Supplier costs rose across all departments again in June, although the annual change for most departments showed a further moderation as costs rise at a less intense pace than previously,\" says Mr Olsen. \"Bakery costs rose the most month-on-month, with larger rises in chilled foods and grocery too. The chilled food increases were driven by higher costs for dairy and chilled meats, and the rise in grocery costs was driven by larger cost increases for grains, chips, and noodles items.\" \"Over 4,000 items increased in cost in June 2023, about 2½ times the number of items back in June 2020. The latest result is still one of the top 20 months for the highest number of items increasing in cost.\"","pubDate":"2023-07-09 17:00:18","image_url":null,"source_id":"voxy","category":["world"],"country":["new zealand"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Zelensky hopes for ‘best outcome’ from Vilnius NATO summit","link":"https://thenewsglory.com/zelensky-hopes-for-best-outcome-from-vilnius-nato-summit/","keywords":["World"],"creator":["The News Glory"],"video_url":null,"description":"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sunday he hoped for “the best possible outcome” of the NATO summit in Vilnius next week, during which kyiv hopes to see its aspirations to join the Alliance come true.

This summit will take place just over a month after the start of a counter-offensive by Ukrainian forces on the front, which has so far achieved only modest gains in the face of strong Russian defensive lines and due to from a lack of air force and artillery ammunition. After receiving Polish President Andrzej Duda in Lutsk in western Ukraine, Mr. Zelensky said the two leaders had agreed to “work together to achieve the best possible result” for Kyiv at the summit scheduled for 11 and July 12 in Lithuania. “We are stronger together,” said the Polish president, one of kyiv’s main supporters within NATO. Ukraine must receive at the Vilnius summit “security guarantees” from the West for lack of accelerated accession to the Alliance as it had hoped. Both Mr. Zelensky and NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg have acknowledged that this prospect is unlikely before the end of the war with Russia. US President Joe Biden, who flew to the UK on Sunday ahead of the summit, was adamant on the issue. “I don’t think she’s ready to be part of NATO,” he swept up in an interview with the American channel CNN about Ukraine, also pointing out that there was no unanimity among the allies on the prospect of bringing Kiev “in the middle of a war”. “We would be at war with Russia if that were the case,” he warned. Repatriated Ukrainian commanders Volodymyr Zelensky returned from Turkey on Saturday, repatriating several commanders of the Azov regiment, taken prisoner by Russia and then exchanged and who were to remain in Turkey until the end of the war, according to an agreement between Moscow and Kiev. Celebrated as heroes in Ukraine but reviled in Russia, their return to Ukraine angered the Kremlin, whose spokesman Dmitry Peskov said was “a direct violation” of the agreement. One of the officers of this regiment close to Ukrainian ultranationalist circles, Denys Prokopenko, quoted by the Interfax-Ukraine press agency, declared immediately that he was going to return to the front. “That’s why we came back to Ukraine. This is our main goal,” said Mr. Prokopenko, who, along with his other comrades-in-arms, had been living in Turkey since September. The heads of Russian and Turkish diplomacy, Sergei Lavrov and Hakan Fidan, raised the issue on Sunday during a phone call, according to Moscow. Mr. Lavrov also warned his counterpart that arms deliveries to kyiv put the country on a “destructive trajectory”, unusually critical words between the two partners. On Saturday, for the 500 days of the war, the Ukrainian president celebrated the “courage” of his people, in an undated video clip where he was seen on Serpents’ Island in the Black Sea, a territory symbol of resistance against in Moscow. The war in Ukraine, which started on February 24, 2022, has killed 9,000 civilians, including 500 children, according to the UN, which estimates that the death toll could be much higher. Cluster bombs In the absence of accelerated NATO membership, Ukraine on Friday obtained from the United States the promise to deliver cluster munitions, a very controversial weapon but which Mr. Zelensky described as “an essential program help”. These weapons, banned in many countries, are widely criticized because they kill indiscriminately by dispersing small explosive charges before or after the impact, accused of causing many collateral civilian victims. Mr Biden said the decision to deliver the bombs had been “difficult” but was “the right thing to do”. The United Kingdom called on Saturday to “discourage their use”, as did Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen who recalled on Sunday “the painful experience” of his country, hit by the United States in the early 1970s. “This would be the greatest danger for Ukrainians for many years,” Hun Sen wrote on Twitter, as Cambodia faced tens of thousands of people maimed or killed by these bombs. Russia denounced this decision on Saturday as an “admission of weakness” in the face of the “failure” of the Ukrainian counter-offensive. Moscow has estimated that Washington is thus making itself an “accomplice” of the civilian victims that these bombs will cause. .","pubDate":"2023-07-09 16:52:28","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenewsglory","category":["world"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"New museum in Alabama tells history of last known slave ship to US and its survivors","link":"https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/world/2023/07/09/new-museum-in-alabama-tells-history-of-last-known-slave-ship-to-us-and-its-survivors","keywords":["World"],"creator":["Feedloaderapi"],"video_url":null,"description":"MOBILE, Ala.

(AP) — A museum that tells the history of the Clotilda — the last ship known to transport Africans to the American South for enslavement — opened Saturday, exactly 163 years after the vessel arrived in Alabama’s Mobile Bay. Ceremonies dedicating the $1.3 million Africatown Heritage House and “Clotilda: The Exhibition” took place Friday and Saturday in Mobile. The exhibit tells about the ship, its survivors and how they founded Africatown community in Mobile after they were freed from five years of slavery following the Civil War. The Clotilda departed Alabama in 1860, more than 50 years after Congress outlawed the importation of additional enslaved people, on a clandestine trip funded by Timothy Meaher, whose descendants still own millions of dollars worth of land around Mobile. The Clotilda illegally transported 110 captive people from what is now the west African nation of Benin to Alabama. The captain, William Foster, transferred women, men and children off the Clotilda once it arrived in Mobile and set fire to the ship to hide evidence of the journey. Most of Clotilda didn’t burn, and much of the ship is still in the Mobile River, which empties into Mobile Bay. Remnants of the Clotilda were discovered in 2019, and Meaher’s descendants released a statement last year calling his actions 160 years ago “evil and unforgivable.” The museum includes a brief history of the transatlantic slave trade and highlights the survivors of the 45-day journey from Africa, AL.com reported. It tells the story of its most famous passenger, Oluale Kossola, better known as Cudjoe Lewis. His interviews in the 1920s provided information about the Clotilda and its passengers to historians and scholars. Other ship survivors are highlighted, including Matlida McCrear, who died in 1940 in Selma, Alabama, and was the Clotilda’s last known survivor. McCrear was separated from her mother at a young age and tried to escape from a slaveholder when she was 3 years old. McCrear and her sister “fled into a swamp, hiding there for hours until dogs sniffed them out,” according to a display in the museum. “I think those who visit will really learn a lot about this particular story,” said Jeremy Ellis, president of the Clotilda Descendants Association and a sixth-generation descendant of Pollee and Rose Allen, who were enslaved and on the Clotilda. “It tells the story of west African culture, what the 110 experienced at the Middle Passage and the first five years of slavery and what they overcame in 1865 in the founding of Africatown.” Advertisement","pubDate":"2023-07-09 16:45:05","image_url":null,"source_id":"winnipegfreepress","category":["world"],"country":["canada"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Organization of Islamic Cooperation condemns desecration of Holy Quran","link":"https://newsghana.com.gh/organization-of-islamic-cooperation-condemns-desecration-of-holy-quran/","keywords":["World News","desccration of Holy Quran","Organization of Islamic Cooperation","Sweden"],"creator":["News Desk"],"video_url":null,"description":"News Ghana, Latest Updates and Breaking News of Ghana, News Desk, https://newsghana.com.gh/organization-of-islamic-cooperation-condemns-desecration-of-holy-quran/OIC) Group in New York, strongly condemns the despicable act of desecration of the Holy Quran outside a mosque in Sweden on the occasion of Eid-ul-Azha.

This abhorrent act is yet another manifestation of the alarming level of the Islamophobic, racist and discriminatory trends spreading across the globe. Such senseless and provocative acts not only trigger widespread anguish among 1.5 billion Muslims but also denigrate their religious sensitivities. In fact, the desecration of any religious scripture is a matter of great concern and goes against the fundamental values of religious coexistence and intercultural dialogue that the United Nations stand for. Such provocative acts are contrary to the spirit of Articles (19) and (20) of the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and cannot be justified under the right to freedom of expression or opinion, which carries responsibilities under international law. They also undermine mutual respect and harmony among peoples and aim at reversing the international efforts to attain a culture of peace, tolerance, and mutual respect. The OIC Group also notes with concern other recent acts of islamophobia, including heinous attacks on mosques and persecution of Muslims around the world driven by religious intolerance, hatred and negative stereotypes. Under international law, States are duty bound to prohibit any advocacy of religious hatred, leading to incitement of violence. The rise in such Islamophobic incidents during the last few months in some European and other countries, despite global condemnation, calls into serious question the legal framework which permits such hate-driven actions. There is a need for a collective resolve to promote inter-faith harmony and peaceful co-existence, the spirit of which was reflected in the commemoration of the first ever International Day to combat islamophobia earlier this year. The United Nations Member States must take credible and concrete measures to prevent the rise of xenophobia, islamophobia and anti-Muslim hatred. The relevant stakeholders must ensure that the perpetrators of such acts are brought to justice and appropriate measures are taken to prevent similar incidents in the future.","pubDate":"2023-07-09 16:39:13","image_url":null,"source_id":"newsghana","category":["world"],"country":["ghana"],"language":"english"},{"title":"This Hotel In Singapore Makes $30,000 A Day By Serving A Famous Drink","link":"https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/this-hotel-in-singapore-makes-30-000-a-day-by-serving-a-famous-drink-4192110","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The bar sells roughly 1000 Singapore Slings a day during peak holiday times.","content":"The signature drink of the luxurious Raffles Hotel was invented in 1915 If you are planning to travel to Singapore for work or leisure, then you must try the iconic Singapore Sling cocktail. The signature drink of the luxurious Raffles Hotel was invented in the historic Long Bar in 1915 by bartender Ngiam Tong Boon and since then it has become the national drink of Singapore. According to News.com.au , the historic drink now sells for $SGD39 a pop - approximately $29 USD. The bar sells roughly 1000 Singapore Slings a day during peak holiday times. The cocktail which is served up in a tall glass is made using gin, cherry liqueur, Cointreau, Benedictine, pineapple juice, lime juice, grenadine and Angostura bitters. Tourists from across the world visit the bar to try the iconic drink. But why are tourists so obsessed with this drink? Well, the answer lies in its history. The News.com.au report said Raffles' Long Bar was a popular gathering place for the community. According to Raffles' website, etiquette rules at the time mandated that it was unacceptable for women to drink alcohol in public. Instead, they would often drink tea or fruit juice. Bartender Ngiam had a light-bulb moment. He decided to create a cocktail that look like fruit juice, but it was infused with gin, grenadine and cherry liqueur. The pink colour of the cocktail gave it a 'feminine flair' and people thought that it was a socially acceptable drink for women. And with that the Singapore Sling was born, a world-famous drink that continues to attract tourists to the bar more than 100 years later. Promoted Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com The bar has another unique tradition, guests are served peanuts and are encouraged to throw the shells all over the floor. While littering in Singapore is not allowed, the hotel's website says that it is the only place where littering is 'encouraged'.

The broadcaster said it first became aware of a complaint in May, but new allegations of a different nature were made to it on Thursday, and it had informed “external authorities”. BBC News said it understood that referred to the police. “This is a complex and fast moving set of circumstances and the BBC is working as quickly as possible to establish the facts in order to properly inform appropriate next steps,” it said in a statement. “We can also confirm a male member of staff has been suspended.” The statement said “it is important that these matters are handled fairly and with care”, without giving details on the claims. The Sun newspaper, which first reported the allegations, cited the young person’s mother as saying the unnamed male presenter had paid the teenager more than 35,000 pounds ($45,000) over three years for the images. The mother told the newspaper that the teenager had used the cash to fund a crack cocaine habit.

To continue reading, please subscribe: + GST for 9 weeks of unlimited access* An Oklahoma judge has thrown out a lawsuit seeking reparations for the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, dashing an effort to obtain some measure of legal justice by survivors of the deadly racist rampage. Judge Caroline Wall on Friday dismissed with prejudice the lawsuit trying to force the city and others to make recompense for the destruction of the once-thriving Black district known as Greenwood. The order comes in a case by three survivors of the attack, who are all now over 100 years old and sued in 2020 with the hope of seeing what their attorney called “justice in their lifetime.” Spokespersons for the city of Tulsa and a lawyer for the survivors — Lessie Benningfield Randle, Viola Fletcher and Hughes Van Ellis — did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday. Wall, a Tulsa County District Court, wrote in a brief order that she was tossing the case based on arguments from the city, regional chamber of commerce and other state and local government agencies. She’d ruled against the defendants’ motions to dismiss and allowed the case to proceed last year. Local judicial elections in Oklahoma are technically nonpartisan, but Wall has described herself as a “Constitutional Conservative” in past campaign questionnaires. The lawsuit was brought under Oklahoma’s public nuisance law, saying the actions of the white mob that killed hundreds of Black residents and destroyed what had been the nation’s most prosperous Black business district continue to affect the city today. It contended that Tulsa’s long history of racial division and tension stemmed from the massacre, during which an angry white mob descended on a 35-block area, looting, killing and burning it to the ground. Beyond those killed, thousands more were left homeless and living in a hastily constructed internment camp. The city and insurance companies never compensated victims for their losses, and the massacre ultimately resulted in racial and economic disparities that still exist today, the lawsuit argued. It sought a detailed accounting of the property and wealth lost or stolen in the massacre, the construction of a hospital in north Tulsa and the creation of a victims compensation fund, among other things. A Chamber of Commerce attorney previously said that the massacre was horrible, but the nuisance it caused was not ongoing. Fletcher, who is 109 and the oldest living survivor, is set to release a memoir next month about the life she lived in the shadow of the massacre. In 2019, Oklahoma’s attorney general used the public nuisance law to force opioid drug maker Johnson & Johnson to pay the state $465 million in damages. The Oklahoma Supreme Court overturned that decision two years later. ___ Bleiberg reported from Dallas and staff writer Michael Biesecker contributed reporting from Washington.

Sophie Busson was 31 when she first found a lump in her left breast. Her GP thought it might be hormonal and Sophie wasn't too worried because she was young, but was booked in for a breast clinic appointment due to a family history of breast cancer. When she got back from a holiday, she was told that she might have cancer. After a biopsy to confirm doctors' suspicions Sophie was told she had an 8cm tumour in her left breast. Her two children Reggie and Leo were just four and 12 years old at the time. Sophie said she \"wasn't prepared for that news at all,\" adding: \"I was terrified that I wouldn't be around to see my children grow up.\" Read more: The best photos from Saturday's Race For Life Pretty Muddy event in Cardiff Her treatment included six sessions of chemotherapy which caused her to lose her hair, eyebrows and eyelashes. She said: \"My youngest son Reggie didn’t understand why I’d lost my hair. He said ‘do I have to call you daddy now?’ because my husband had a shaved head as well.\" In April 2018 Sophie began a ten-year treatment on preventative drug Tamoxifen. She also underwent a left side mastectomy, surgery to remove lymph nodes and 15 sessions of radiotherapy. After around two years and a failed reconstruction surgery she had a successful reconstruction in December 2019.

I am hopeful that treatment will do its thing and keep me around for as long as possible.\" Now 37 and celebrating 20 years with her husband Gareth, Sophie says \"life's too short\" not to enjoy it, adding: \"You don't know what's 'round the corner. I will never take a birthday or life moment for granted because growing old is a true privilege.\" The family went to the Maldives on holiday and Sophie celebrated her 37th birthday with Gareth by going to Newcastle to see their favourite artist Sam Fender perform at St James' Park.

Sophie started the Pretty Muddy event on Saturday (Image: Mark Lewis) \"My cancer won't ever go away,\" Sophie said, \"and that is the hardest thing to have to accept. I'm not indestructible. I will have days when cancer knocks me down and I need to give myself time when it does. \"But I will always keep my fiery determination to keep pushing on, because cancer’s created its own worst enemy in me and I will keep pushing on no matter what. So, cancer, I’ll give you a day here and there, but that’s your lot because time’s ticking and this gal’s got s*** to do!\" Sophie is now determined to turn her experience into something positive and encourage people to raise money to fund essential research: \"Research is key for someone like me who relies on new treatments being developed to give me more time with my loved ones.

The strike on Friday resulted in the death of Osama al-Muhajer, IS leader in eastern Syria, Centcom said in a statement. “We have made it clear that we remain committed to the defeat of ISIS throughout the region,” Centcom chief General Michael Kurilla was quoted as saying, using another acronym for the IS jihadist group. “ISIS remains a threat, not only to the region but well beyond,” he added. According to Centcom, no civilians were killed in the operation but coalition forces are “assessing reports of a civilian injury”. Friday’s strike, Centcom said, “was conducted by the same MQ-9s (drones) that had… been harassed by Russian aircraft in an encounter that had lasted almost two hours”.

According to Centcom, no civilians were killed in the operation but coalition forces are “assessing reports of a civilian injury”.

(AP) — A 19-year-old man is in custody in connection with a mass shooting a week ago inside a Kansas nightclub, and police have identified a second man being sought. Wichita police arrested the man Friday as a suspect in the shooting on July 2 at City Nightz in downtown Wichita. Nine people suffered gunshot wounds and two others were trampled in the chaos that followed the 1 a.m. shooting. No one died. It wasn’t immediately clear if the man has been charged. Police on Saturday also asked for the public’s assistance in finding a 23-year-old man they believe is connected to the shooting. A St. Louis-area man was arrested July 3, but prosecutors later determined he fired his gun acting in self-defense after shots were fired by two other men at the club. The gunshot victims — seven men and two women — ranged in age from 22 to 34, police said. The two people trampled were a 30-year-old woman and a 31-year-old male. Wichita is a city of nearly 400,000 people, located about 200 miles (320 kilometers) southwest of Kansas City, Missouri.

The economic impact payment, or the third stimulus check, was huge, comprising 54% of the total funds. The previous packages under the Trump administration placed a larger emphasis on business-directed assistance. The economic impact of the pandemic has been vast, even unmeasurable, and weighed most heavily on vulnerable populations, especially folks experiencing homelessness and poverty. The American Rescue Plan was hailed as a significant win for the Democrats by the media, especially for Americans living in poverty. Not only does the bill include direct stimulus payments to individuals making less than $75,000 and married couples filing jointly and making less than $150,000 a year. The Rescue Plan even provided a stimulus check to dependents and the amount was also $1,400, the same that was given to each filer. Other provisions that were included in the Rescue Plan included expanded benefits for the unemployed, an expanded version of the Child Tax Credit, and state investments aimed to help with the distribution of vaccines and the reopening of schools. A Columbia University report states that the package comprising both the additional investments in programs and the direct stimulus checks brought down poverty rates by 30% and reduced the number of children living in poverty by half. Universal Basic Income Preempts Economic Woes Unlike The Stimulus Checks Nobody doubted that the stimulus check was a step in the right direction. But there was also the question of the need to address economic woes through preemption rather than through mitigation. An alternative method to bring down individual financial instability and also reduce poverty is the concept of a universal basic income. The very word, universal, indicates that the UBI is for everyone, regardless of socioeconomic, employment, and housing status. And the crucial difference between the concept of universal basic income and stimulus checks is that the UBI concept provided direct stimulus checks to individuals for an extended period of time, if not for an unlimited period of time, unlike the one-off stimulus checks. The stimulus check has always been a sporadic effort and has been dependent upon legislation each time the payments were necessary. This sporadic nature of stimulus checks has led to a more extended system to support the American poor through the universal basic income model. Cities and local bodies have started the concept of universal basic through pilot projects, and they are steadily gaining success. Cities and states are now adopting the model while those who have passed through the pilot project routine are now expanding the concept. A basic income case project from Stockton in California was recently in the news. Two years ago a monthly stimulus check of $500 was given to 125 individuals who were selected randomly. The main criteria for selection were that these individuals were below the median income of the city of Stockton, which was $45,000 in a year. The recipients of the stimulus checks were able to spend the money as they wished. They were not obligated to complete any drug test, aset or means test, interviews, or even any work requirements. The beneficiaries just got the stimulus checks, no questions asked, no strings attached. The regular stimulus checks had a huge impact on those who received them. A comparison of those who received this monthly payment with those who did not show the glaring difference. The study showed that there was a marked decrease in income volatility and the figure was as significant as 22% for those who received the payments. It has been seen that the overwhelming number of beneficiaries were using the $500 to purchase only essentials such as food, utilities, and clothing. A second crucial discovery was that the stimulus checks did not dissuade people from looking for work or joining the workforce. Rather as households were now in a more stable position, they were free to now access resources that helped them progress further in their field of work. With a more stable financial position, they could not spend time looking for more permanent and sustainable work. Stimulus Check But the concept of a universal basic income is only opposed by the Republicans. Their major critiques are that it will dissuade people from joining the workforce, a line that is similar to what the Republicans used when they opposed the pandemic stimulus checks. The Stockton Stimulus Checks Challenged The Opposition By The Republicans The Stockton pilot project proved an eye-opener. For one, as has been mentioned before, the monthly stimulus checks did not dissuade people from going to work. Rather, it provided them the time to find suitable jobs and engage with their communities. There was even a rise in the percentage of jobs with full-time participants’ share growing by 12 percentage points as against only 5 percentage points in the control group. Secondly, the cost of moving out people of poverty also alleviated the economy in various areas. For instance, healthcare was a beneficiary. Toxic stress that has always been linked to finances is normally pervasive and also expensive for both the system and the individual. But the freeing up of resources will definitely serve the community in the long run. The former mayor of Stockton, Michael Tubbs stressed the point when he revealed that much of the societal illness is due to toxic stress and the high levels of cortisol and anxiety. These are directly linked to the volatility that low and moderate-income families usually face. Most families are just a payment away from being either thrown out on the streets or starvation and in most cases, both. The pain of not having enough to cover the necessities of your family is one of the most stressful situations that a parent can face. And that has become even more true post the pandemic. Financially stable households have the ability to come together to become vibrant, healthy communities. Most cities are planning to go the Stockton way with Chicago and Los Angeles already off the mark.

It is unknown if Williams and Chapman were associates. Chapman also posted a status condemning guns in a failed attempt to distance himself from his crimes, the Liverpool Echo reports. Chapman, 23, was this week found guilty of the murder of Elle Edwards who was killed in a botched gangland shooting. Elle, 26, had been enjoying a night out with her sister and friends when she was hit twice in the back of the head outside the Lighthouse pub in Wallasey Village. Elle Edwards (Image: PA) Five men were also injured - one critically - but all of them survived. A jury of seven women and five men came to a unanimous decision after three hours and 48 minutes of deliberation, following a three-and-a-half week trial at Liverpool Crown Court. Chapman’s friend Thomas Waring, 20, was convicted of possession of a prohibited weapon, and also assisting an offender by helping Chapman torch the stolen black Mercedes car used to flee the scene. Drug dealer Chapman was jailed for the reckless murder of Elle in what was the \"culmination\" of a violent, tit-for-tat feud between the Woodchurch group and its Wirral rival, a gang based around the Beechwood/Ford estate on the opposite side of the M53 motorway. Two of the men shot on Christmas Eve, Kieran Salkeld and Jake Duffy, were described as involved in the Beechwood gang and are already serving jail sentences for dishing out a savage beating to Woodchurch-linked Sam Searson, the day before the shooting. Salkeld was the most severely injured of the survivors after Chapman's bullet penetrated his chest causing internal bleeding and organ damage, while Duffy was wounded in both legs. Three other men injured by the volley of bullets; Harry Loughran, Liam Carr and Nicholas Speed, all described as “innocent bystanders”, made quicker recoveries.

I can't thank the police enough for what they did, and we got there in the end, the right result. \"I hope those two never see another Christmas again ever in their lives.

(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has been environment the armed forces to a huge range of nontraditional tasks considering that he was elected in 2018, developing issues about the separation of the armed forces from civilian lifestyle. A new airport was crafted by the army outside Mexico Town a calendar year ago at a price tag of $4.1 billion. It is run by the military but little utilized. López Obrador suggests the previous airport, the country’s busiest, will be operate by the navy. The navy took demand of protection at Mexico Metropolis International Airport, or Benito Juárez, additional than a yr in the past. It will shortly have handle of every thing else, from customs and immigration to managing baggage and cleansing bogs, with the imminent publication of a presidential get to make that formal. The list of troubles at Mexico City Airport has extended integrated key drug shipments and unlawful migration. Infrastructure was in disrepair, and a selection of shut calls have been reported on the runways in new a long time as the airport increasingly experienced hassle dealing with flights. The airport also had a track record for stolen baggage, mismanaged airline schedules, small business without contracts and corruption. Meanwhile, López Obrador has gone to the armed forces for support through his term, supplying them some immigration responsibilities and management of ports and customs. They are also making significant infrastructure jobs such as a vacationer coach via the Yucatan Peninsula and a new airport in the very same region. They even operate plant nurseries and vacationer visits to a previous penal colony. The airport, which is used by some 4 million vacationers every thirty day period, will be “a business in just a naval military entity,” Rear Adm. Carlos Velázquez Tiscareño, the airport’s 73-calendar year-aged director, explained in a the latest interview. But, he explained, “this is not likely to appear like a military department.” (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Not like the capital’s other airport, Felipe Angeles, wherever Nationwide Guard troops get passenger tickets at the gate, at Benito Juarez the only uniformed military services are the 1,500 marines deployed since February 2022 for security. The rest of the airport personnel will be civilians but “with clearer procedures … that govern with a lot more order and self-control,” Velázquez Tiscareño mentioned. The navy will form a corporation called Casiopea to operate the airport and six other people that have “deficiencies” and are “in the arms of structured crime,” Velázquez Tiscareño explained. Among them will be Matamoros, throughout the border from Texas, and Playa del Carmen on the Gulf of Mexico. López Obrador has already said that he designs to have a dozen airports in the palms of the army or navy by the stop of his administration in 2024. And by the close of this year, the military is scheduled to begin functioning its possess industrial airline. The Mexico Town takeover runs opposite to international aviation recommendations that obviously distinguish among armed service and civilian, said Rogelio Rodríguez Garduño, an aviation law qualified at Mexico’s Nationwide Autonomous University. But the legal effects of the shift keep on being unclear. Previously this 12 months, Mexico’s Supreme Court docket dominated that the transfer of the Countrywide Guard from civilian to army manage was unconstitutional. López Obrador still left the guard below a civilian department but with a armed forces operational main. When navy operational manage could help some security concerns, industry experts don’t feel it will solve other issues. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration downgraded Mexico’s aviation basic safety score in 2021, avoiding Mexican airlines from expanding flights to the U.S. FAA security scores of other countries are created to evaluate these countries’ oversight of their airways but do not imply that the airlines are unsafe. In Mexico, corruption received to the issue several years back that coded messages were despatched working with airport inside communications to maintain up baggage inspections so drug shipments could pass untouched, in accordance to testimony during the U.S. demo of former Community Safety Secretary Genaro Luna. He was convicted of drug trafficking in February. Mexico Metropolis has the country’s most crucial airport, and the navy is the department of Mexican security forces in which the U.S. authorities have the most self confidence, but the U.S. has not commented on the raising electric power of the Mexican army. “There are many airports in the region that have experienced large complications for a lot of decades, and they had to be fixed,” explained Velázquez Tiscareño, himself a retired pilot. In the past yr, the navy’s security oversight has shut down some unlawful business within the airport, improved inspections and lowered stolen luggage, Velázquez Tiscareño claimed. Some airport staff affirm that, but take note far too that complaints about flight delays carry on. “The navy has place issues beneath bigger regulate, but now we will need to see how they are heading to operate,” claimed José Beltrán, 72, who picks up trash at the airport. “It’s additional tranquil,” said Luis Martinez, who’s been operating at the airport for 25 yrs, supporting travellers who have to have wheelchairs. But, he claimed, “people have the very same issues: flight delays and challenges with luggage.” Rodríguez Garduño mentioned Mexican aviation requires a lot more revenue, additional training and inspection regimes, between other measure, to elevate its competitiveness on the global stage. He reported he was not absolutely sure if the navy could enable clear up all those people problems.

Read this article for free: Already have an account? To continue reading, please subscribe: + GST for 9 weeks of unlimited access* WASHINGTON (AP) — After major blows to his agenda by the Supreme Court, President Joe Biden is intent on making sure voters will have the final say. When the court’s conservative majority effectively killed his plan to cancel or reduce federal student loan debts for millions of people, Biden said, “Republicans snatched away the hope that they were given.” When the justices ended race-based affirmative action in college admissions, he said, “This is not a normal court.” When they overturned Roe v. Wade and a national right to abortion last year, the president said, “Voters need to make their voices heard.” As Biden heads into the 2024 election, he is running not only against the Republicans who control one-half of Congress but also against the conservative bloc that dominates the nation’s highest court. It’s a subtle but significant shift in approach toward the Supreme Court, treating it more like a political entity even as Biden stops short of calling for an overhaul. That shift is becoming apparent in everything from the White House’s messaging to its legal strategy. “The president respects the court’s authority, but if its judgments are going to be political and there are members of the court who are saying that, he owes it to voters to make it clear what his positions are and what he’s doing to address it,” said Ron Klain, his former chief of staff. “Many members of the current court testified that Roe is settled law and still overturned it,” he added, referring to the court’s ruling on abortion. “That has its consequences.” Biden, who once led the Senate Judiciary Committee, is focusing on the politicization of the court as a way to encourage voters to back him. Yet he has not embraced any effort to make big changes to the court. Instead, Biden is increasingly vocal about his belief that the court is abandoning mainstream constitutional interpretation. He tells voters they need more Democrats in Congress and a Democrat in the White House to counter the impact of the conservative-leaning court. Biden has won his share of cases, including on immigration, before a court where conservatives hold a 6-3 majority. But the student loan defeat capped a term when justices imposed significant roadblocks. White House officials say Biden is keen to explore other ways to pursue the same priorities and explain to the American people about the obstacles. “There’s only upside in running against the court as an institution because the court is doing things that are wildly unpopular and they’re preventing the president from implementing his agenda,” said Chris Kang, chief counsel of the progressive group Demand Justice and a onetime deputy counsel to President Barack Obama. “I think that it’s important to make clear that the Supreme Court is making it impossible to implement and advance policies that should not have any controversy attached to them,” he added. Republicans are working to portray Biden as overstepping his legal authority in pursuit of his agenda. They say the high court’s policies are in step with much of the country and they are trying to motivate their own voters by highlighting what the GOP has achieved through court rulings. Former President Donald Trump, at the recent Faith and Freedom Coalition conference in Washington, praised the three justices he had nominated to the Supreme Court. “Exactly one year ago today, those justices were the pivotal votes in the Supreme Court’s landmark decision ending the constitutional atrocity known as Roe v. Wade,” Trump said. He drew a standing ovation by noting that “conservatives had been trying for 50 years,” to overturn that ruling. “But I got it done and nobody ever thought it was a possibility.” Other administration officials said the court’s conservative dominance has lowered the political cost to Biden when the justices scuttle some of his legally suspect actions such as on student loans and coronavirus mandates. On the latter, the Supreme Court struck down Biden’s attempt to require employees of large companies to get shots but left the requirement in place for health care workers, though by that time the pandemic had started to wane. Klain insisted that everything Biden has put forward had a solid legal basis and was approved by the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel. “There was no sense of taking the legal issues lightly or just ‘do it and take whatever the court says,’’ he said. Confidence in the Supreme Court fell to its lowest point in at least 50 years after the leaked draft opinion in the abortion case in 2022. Those who view the current court favorably are largely Republican. According to the Pew Research Center’s September 2022 report, only 28% of Democrats and Democrat-leaning independents now view the court favorably, down nearly 40 percentage points since 2020. And people in the United States increasingly favor term limits. Positive views of the court among Republicans and those who lean Republican has increased to 73%. As a result, the partisan gap is larger than at any other point in the 35 years of polling that Pew has done on the court. Republicans have focused for years on remaking the federal judiciary and Supreme Court. When Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-K.Y., was the majority leader, he refused to even meet in 2016 with Obama’s pick for the high court — current Attorney General Merrick Garland, a federal judge at that time. The nomination stalled until a Republican president, Trump, took over. Establishment GOP operatives backed Trump because of his pledge to name as many judges to the bench as possible. Their gamble worked. Trump ended up with three Supreme Court nominees and 54 federal appeals court judges, reshaping the courts for a generation. Democrats are now finally understanding the power of judges as a voting tool, and Biden has made judicial nominations a priority, appointing a record number of judges for a president at this point in his first term, including some of the most diverse picks yet to the judiciary. Biden aides plan on highlighting those accomplishments during the reelection campaign, but acknowledge it’s only a small salve to their troubles at the high court. Biden has taken to warning voters about what else the Supreme Court might do in the future, whether rolling back same-sex marriage rights or access to contraception. “President Biden is being direct with the American people about the stakes these extreme decisions that jettison decades of longstanding precedent have for their fundamental freedoms and their daily lives,” said White House spokesman Andrew Bates. Part of Biden’s unwillingness to go further to reshape the Supreme Court comes from a sense of history. Those pushing social change stood by the court after Brown v. Board of Education, a major civil rights case, and even Roe v. Wade, holding up its autonomy as a way to push forward. Backing away from that, particularly for an establishment Democrat like Biden, is not easy. As Biden said in an interview with MSNBC, “I think if we start the process of trying to expand the court, we’re going to politicize it maybe forever in a way that is not healthy,” Leah Litman, a professor of law at the University of Michigan and co-host of “Strict Scrutiny” podcast about the Supreme Court, said that while Biden was unlikely to go that far, “there are a variety of things that Democratic politicians could run on that would actually allow them to more explicitly push back against the court.” Besides expanding the size of the Supreme Court and or the lower courts, she said, other options include stripping the Supreme Court of jurisdiction over certain cases, setting term limits and implementing ethics changes. All of them, she said, are things the party could embrace “as part of their recognition that the court has politicized itself.” __ Follow the AP’s coverage of the U.S. Supreme Court at https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court Advertisement","pubDate":"2023-07-09 15:43:50","image_url":null,"source_id":"winnipegfreepress","category":["world"],"country":["canada"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Man sought in Nebraska homicide, armed carjacking shot and killed by police in Iowa","link":"https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/world/2023/07/09/man-sought-in-nebraska-homicide-armed-carjacking-shot-and-killed-by-police-in-iowa","keywords":["World"],"creator":["Feedloaderapi"],"video_url":null,"description":"COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa (AP) — A man sought in connection with a fatal shooting and an armed carjacking in Nebraska was shot and killed by police officers in Iowa following […]","content":"COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa (AP) — A man sought in connection with a fatal shooting and an armed carjacking in Nebraska was shot and killed by police officers in Iowa following a chase.

Police in Omaha, Nebraska, responded to a domestic assault call before 6 a.m. Saturday and learned that 41-year-old Matthew Briggs had broken into a home and assaulted a woman, police said in a news release. She was able to escape. Minutes later, police learned that Briggs drove his car through the garage door of a home nearby. The woman who lived there wasn’t home but Briggs shot at a neighbor who came over to check on him, police said. The neighbor was unhurt. Around 7 a.m., police were called to a third home and found 52-year-old Steven Donsbach shot to death. Briggs was named as a person of interest. On Saturday afternoon, a Toyota Camry was carjacked in suburban Omaha by a man matching Briggs’ description. Officers spotted the car and a pursuit began. The chase crossed into Iowa. In Council Bluff, the Toyota crashed and two officers — one from Omaha and one from Council Bluffs — shot Briggs. He died at a hospital. Omaha police did not say what prompted the shooting, but said two guns were found in the stolen car Briggs was driving. Both officers are on paid administrative pending an investigation by the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation.

To continue reading, please subscribe: + GST for 9 weeks of unlimited access* MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico’s armed forces are taking control of the capital’s main airport, and the government plans to give the military control of nearly a dozen more across the country as the president takes aim at corruption and mismanagement. President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has been setting the armed forces to a wide range of nontraditional tasks since he was elected in 2018, creating concerns about the separation of the military from civilian life. A new airport was built by the army outside Mexico City a year ago at a cost of $4.1 billion. It is run by the military but little used. López Obrador says the old airport, the country’s busiest, will be run by the navy. The navy took charge of security at Mexico City International Airport, or Benito Juárez, more than a year ago. It will soon have control of everything else, from customs and immigration to handling luggage and cleaning bathrooms, with the imminent publication of a presidential order to make that official. The list of problems at Mexico City Airport has long included major drug shipments and illegal migration. Infrastructure was in disrepair, and a number of close calls were reported on the runways in recent years as the airport increasingly had trouble handling flights. The airport also had a reputation for stolen luggage, mismanaged airline schedules, business without contracts and corruption. Meanwhile, López Obrador has gone to the armed forces for help throughout his term, giving them some immigration duties and control of ports and customs. They are also building major infrastructure projects such as a tourist train through the Yucatan Peninsula and a new airport in the same area. They even run plant nurseries and tourist trips to a former penal colony. The airport, which is used by some 4 million travelers each month, will be “a company within a naval military entity,” Rear Adm. Carlos Velázquez Tiscareño, the airport’s 73-year-old director, said in a recent interview. But, he said, “this is not going to look like a military department.” Unlike the capital’s other airport, Felipe Angeles, where National Guard troops take passenger tickets at the gate, at Benito Juarez the only uniformed military are the 1,500 marines deployed since February 2022 for security. The rest of the airport personnel will be civilians but “with clearer rules … that govern with more order and discipline,” Velázquez Tiscareño said. The navy will form a company called Casiopea to run the airport and six others that have “deficiencies” and are “in the hands of organized crime,” Velázquez Tiscareño said. Among them will be Matamoros, across the border from Texas, and Playa del Carmen on the Gulf of Mexico. López Obrador has already said that he plans to have a dozen airports in the hands of the army or navy by the end of his administration in 2024. And by the end of this year, the military is scheduled to begin operating its own commercial airline. The Mexico City takeover runs contrary to international aviation recommendations that clearly distinguish between military and civilian, said Rogelio Rodríguez Garduño, an aviation law expert at Mexico’s National Autonomous University. But the legal consequences of the move remain unclear. Earlier this year, Mexico’s Supreme Court ruled that the transfer of the National Guard from civilian to military control was unconstitutional. López Obrador left the guard under a civilian department but with a military operational chief. While navy operational control could help some security issues, experts don’t believe it will resolve other problems. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration downgraded Mexico’s aviation safety rating in 2021, preventing Mexican airlines from expanding flights to the U.S. FAA safety ratings of other countries are designed to measure those countries’ oversight of their airlines but do not mean that the airlines are unsafe. In Mexico, corruption got to the point years ago that coded messages were sent using airport internal communications to hold up baggage inspections so drug shipments could pass untouched, according to testimony during the U.S. trial of former Public Security Secretary Genaro Luna. He was convicted of drug trafficking in February. Mexico City has the country’s most important airport, and the navy is the branch of Mexican security forces in which the U.S. authorities have the most confidence, but the U.S. has not commented on the increasing power of the Mexican military. “There are various airports in the country that have had big problems for many years, and they had to be fixed,” said Velázquez Tiscareño, himself a retired pilot. In the past year, the navy’s security oversight has shut down some illegal business inside the airport, improved inspections and reduced stolen luggage, Velázquez Tiscareño said. Some airport workers confirm that, but note too that complaints about flight delays continue. “The navy has put things under greater control, but now we need to see how they’re going to work,” said José Beltrán, 72, who picks up trash at the airport. “It’s more peaceful,” said Luis Martinez, who’s been working at the airport for 25 years, helping passengers who need wheelchairs. But, he said, “people have the same complaints: flight delays and problems with luggage.” Rodríguez Garduño said Mexican aviation needs more money, more training and inspection regimes, among other measure, to raise its competitiveness on the global stage. He said he was not sure if the military could help solve all those problems.

In its second weekend in theaters, the Disney release was usurped by another franchise fifth – “ Insidious: The Red Door.” The horror film starring and directed by Patrick Wilson scared up $32.7 million in ticket sales from 3,188 theaters, according to studio estimates on Sunday. It did better than the last installment, “Insidious: The Last Key,” from 2018 and is the most any PG-13 horror movie has earned in its debut in the past two years. “Insidious 5” was not well reviewed — but modestly budgeted scary movies are often critic-proof when it comes to the box office. This Blumhouse-produced franchise starring Wilson and Rose Byrne began in 2011 under the direction of James Wan and has been responsible for over $570 million in global box office returns — and none of the films have cost more than $16 million to produce. Only the first movie received a “fresh” rating on Rotten Tomatoes; The “Insidious” films more often garner sub 40% scores. It was shrewd of Sony to release “Insidious” on the weekend between two Hollywood tentpoles, in this case “ Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny ” and “ Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part I,” which opens on Wednesday. “Indiana Jones 5” took second place in its second weekend with $26.5 million in North America (down 56% from its opening), bringing its domestic total to $121.2 million. Globally it’s earned an estimated $247.9 million. “ Joy Ride ” also made its theatrical debut this weekend in 2,820 locations and earned an underwhelming $5.9 million. The R-rated comedy directed and co-written by Adele Lim follows four friends on an international trip, played by Ashley Park, Sherry Cola, Stephanie Hsu and Sabrina Wu. The modestly budgeted Lionsgate release got rave reviews out of the South by Southwest Film Festival and maintains a 91% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, but it didn’t motivate big crowds this weekend. Those that did go (58% women, 72% over age 25, according to PostTrak) gave it a B- CinemaScore, suggesting the movie did not meet expectations, which can sometimes be because of how the film was marketed. The hope is that word-of-mouth might help “Joy Ride” in the coming weeks. “Joy Ride” is one of several raunchy, adult comedies in theaters this summer, including the Jennifer Lawrence movie “No Hard Feelings,” which earned $5.2 million in its third weekend, bringing its domestic total to $40.3 million. In more limited release, “The Lesson,” a literary chamber thriller starring Richard E. Grant and Daryl McCormack, opened to $157,752 from 268 screens.

In heart-shaped pink sunglasses, he thanked his fans for their support throughout the decades. \"You have no idea what it means to me, your kindness.

The day is a public holiday, as per the 201 Nunavut Day Holiday Order, and commemorates the passing of two Nunavut acts. Nunavut Day marks the day when the Parliament of Canada passed the Nunavut Act, officially declaring Nunavut as a distinct region that is legally separate from the Northwest Territories along with the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement. On July 9, 1993, the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement Act took effect, and the Nunavut was established on April 1, 1999. The day was declared an official government holiday in the year 2001. As we celebrate Nunavut Day 2023, here’s all you need to know about the history and significance of the day. Canada Joins Global Movement, Bans Use of Animals To Test Cosmetic Products. Nunavut Day 2023 will be celebrated on Sunday, July 9. The Parliament of Canada passed the Nunavut Act on July 9, 1993, following the passing of the 1982 plebiscite on the question of the division of the Northwest Territories. The Act led to the establishment of the territory of Nunavut. On April 1, 1999, Nunavut became a legally distinct territory from the Northwest Territories. The following year, in 2000, 'Nunavut Day' was celebrated on April 1. However, it was felt that the 1993 Nunavut Land Claims Agreement had greater significance to the people of Nunavut, so the holiday was moved to July 9. Nunavut Day holds great significance for the people of Nunavut, Canada, as the day marks the formation of this territory. Nunavut Day is a perfect opportunity for people to honour the efforts of those who helped to bring this territory into being. An important symbol of Nunavut Territory is a blue and white image of a polar bear on an iceberg with a star in the sky. On July 9, 1993, the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement Act took effect, and Nunavut was established on April 1, 1999. The word ‘Nunavut’ means ‘our land’ in the native language Inuktitut. On Nunavut Day, people organize cultural activities like community-wide breakfasts, traditional games, food fest and other events and celebrate this historic day.

To continue reading, please subscribe: + GST for 9 weeks of unlimited access* NEW YORK (AP) — An influencer-backed energy drink that has earned viral popularity among children is facing scrutiny from lawmakers and health experts over its potentially dangerous levels of caffeine. On Sunday, Sen. Charles Schumer called on the Food and Drug Administration to investigate PRIME, a beverage brand founded by the YouTube stars Logan Paul and KSI that has become something of an obsession among the influencers’ legions of young followers. “One of the summer’s hottest status symbols for kids is not an outfit, or a toy—it’s a beverage,” said Schumer, a Democrat from New York. “But buyer and parents beware because it’s a serious health concern for the kids it so feverishly targets.” Backed by two of YouTube’s best known stars, PRIME was an immediate sensation when it launched last year, prompting long lines in grocery stores and reports of school yard resale markets. Advertising itself as zero sugar and vegan, the neon-colored cans are among a growing number of energy drinks with elevated levels of caffeine; in PRIME’s case, 200 milligrams per 12 ounces, equivalent to about half a dozen Coke cans or nearly two Red Bulls. That high content prompted bans from some schools in the United Kingdom and Australia where some pediatricians warned of possible health impacts on young children such as heart problems, anxiety, and digestive issues. Company representatives, meanwhile, have defended the product as clearly labeled “not recommended for children under 18.” They sell a separate sports drink, known as PRIME Hydration, which contains no caffeine at all. Representatives for PRIME did not immediately return a request for comment. But in his letter to the FDA, Schumer claimed there was little noticeable difference in the online marketing of the two drinks – leading many parents to believe they were purchasing a juice for their kids, only to wind up with a “cauldron of caffeine.” “A simple search on social media for Prime will generate an eye-popping amount of sponsored content, which is advertising,” he wrote. “This content and the claims made should be investigated, along with the ingredients and the caffeine content in the Prime energy drink.” Advertisement","pubDate":"2023-07-09 15:28:25","image_url":null,"source_id":"winnipegfreepress","category":["world"],"country":["canada"],"language":"english"},{"title":"United States: TikTok’s ‘boat jumping’ challenge claims 4 lives in Alabama, officials urge people to stay away from it","link":"https://www.opindia.com/2023/07/united-states-tiktoks-boat-jumping-challenge-claims-4-lives-in-alabama/","keywords":["News Reports","Social Media","World","Alabama","Tiktok","TikTok trend","United States"],"creator":["Rukma Rathore"],"video_url":null,"description":"Fatal deaths caused by TikTok challenge called the 'boat jumping challenge' occurred in Alabama in USA","content":"OpIndia bringing the \\'right\\' side of India OpIndia bringing the \\'right\\' side of India Monday, July 10, 2023 Latest News About Us Contact Us Write for Us MyVoice Facebook Instagram RSS Twitter Youtube OpIndia bringing the \\'right\\' side of India Politics West Bengal Panchayat Polls: Re-polling to be held at over 600 booths on 10th July after reports of violence and tampering with Ballot boxes SP leader poses as a vegetable vendor who hired bouncers to protect pricey tomatoes, PTI presents it as a real incident Another NCP MLA Kiran Lahamate leaves Sharad Pawar’s faction to join Ajit Pawar, more including MLA Ashutosh Kale expected to follow suit Netherlands: As the longest-serving Dutch PM Mark Rutte resigns, read how the coalition govt collapsed over the burning refugee issue Bengal panchayat polls: Abandoned ballot boxes found in a drain in Murshidabad Opinions This West Bengal panchayat election, I sense the beginning of the end of TMC US ambassador Eric Garcetti pontificates on Manipur violence when his own country has seen 332 mass shootings, over 21000 gun-related deaths in 2023 alone From soft power ascendancy to global leadership: India’s inspiring rise and future prospects in the international arena Do not demean the Indian school education system, it prepares you to be the best Eight years of PM Modi’s Digital India initiative: Empowering the nation with technological advancements and inclusive growth Fact-Check All Media Fact-Check Political Fact-Check Social Media Fact-Check SP leader poses as a vegetable vendor who hired bouncers to protect pricey tomatoes, PTI presents it as a real incident Fact Check: The Wire peddles lies, claims ‘Pune school Principal thrashed for conducting ‘Dear Lord’ prayers, no CCTV in girls’ washroom’, here is what...

They were doing a TikTok challenge. It’s where you get in a boat going at a high rate of speed, you jump off the side of the boat, don’t dive, you’re jumping off feet first and you just kinda lean into the water.” “I think individuals caught up in the accident were likely to do something stupid because they wanted to show it off on their social media for clout and their friends,” he mentioned and expressed his concern that this fatal fad will grow over the summer. “That is a very big concern because we have seen this pattern emerge over the last two years and it’s sporadic. But it’s something that needs to go away and stay away.” TikTok boat jumping challenge that sees people leap off vessels moving at high speed is blamed for FOUR deaths in Alabama – as cop says victims broke their necks instantly. pic.twitter.com/2aCxvJZsRy — Molly Ploofkins™ (@Mollyploofkins) July 9, 2023 The captain noted that although the challenge dubbed as boat jumping, has been a problem for first responders for the past two years, it has gotten worse since the beginning of the year. The first victim drowned in the Coosa River in February while his wife, three children and other closed ones looked on from the boat. “Unfortunately, she recorded his death,” the official informed. A middle-aged male was involved in the most recent occurrence in May. He is appealing to people to refrain from doing the challenge and requesting that loved ones keep their family and friends from jumping. “Do not do it. It’s not worth your life.” Any variation of the two terms, such as “boat jumping” brings up videos of daredevils potentially experiencing what he dubbed “instant death.” The participants range from all ages. The landing pad is hazardous and feels like concrete due to the boat’s fast rate of speed and the motionless water. Without protecting their neck and head, a person jumping from a moving boat risks becoming permanently paralysed, if not possibly dying instantly. Jim Dennis recommended dialling 911 right away if anyone doesn’t see their loved one resurface after jumping. He advised, “Try to stay in the region, but if you must depart, make sure to mark the place with something from the boat, your phone, or your boat’s technology.” While the people are jumping into the water as part of the challenge, it is causing severe injuries and fractures. Because when someone jumps from a speeding boat, the water acts like a hard surface, resulting in severe injuries. In all four deaths, the necks of the victims broke, resulting in instant deaths.

That might be about to change though after a video came to light showing how they are made. A crabstick factory, based in Thailand, has shown the process of making the fishy sticks and some people have vowed to never eat them again after watching the video, the Mirror reports. Sold widely around the UK, the savoury sticks are a go-to for some seafood lovers, but after a video was posted, people are disgusted and are now branding it a 'fish hot-dog'. Starting off as concreate-like substance, the crab meat goes through a range of processes, before it is dyed red and white. The frozen fish meat blocks are put through a machine and crushed up to create a grey paste, before travelling along a conveyor belt where salt and other flavourings are added. It all becomes very dull looking, and is a far cry from what we're used to seeing on the supermarket shelves. The fishy mix is then blended with ice as well as vegetable oil and sugars. Workers are seen putting it through a tube which transforms it into a huge whipped, grey pile of paste, before it gets moulded into strips and dyed the distinct colour and shape. Once dyed, it is wrapped in the classic packaging and frozen ready to head to our shelves. Subscribe here for the latest news where you live Claiming to be the world's largest, this factory is said to produce 40,000 tons of fish sticks per year - four times heavier than the Eiffel Tower and sold to over 37 countries. People have been quick to comment on the video, with one person dubbing the sticks as \"hot dogs of the sea\". Another said \"the only ingredient I could identify was the ice\" Meanwhile, someone else jibed: \"Everything ok hun? You've hardly touched your grey\" due to the colour of the original paste. Another person said: \"Bet that place smells wonderful\" A third added: \"If the title hadn't specified they were making crabsticks, or in fact any type of food, I would've gotten to 1:38 before I realised that they weren't making some sort of industrial building material.\"","pubDate":"2023-07-09 15:11:39","image_url":"https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/article27287575.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_Crab-sticks.jpg","source_id":"walesonline","category":["politics","health","top","world"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"BBC suspends presenter over claims he paid a teenager for explicit photos","link":"http://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2023/jul/09/bbc-suspends-presenter-over-claims-he-paid-a-teenager-for-explicit-photos-2593063.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Though the age of sexual consent in Britain is 16, it's a crime to make or possess indecent images of anyone under 18.

Read this article for free: Already have an account? To continue reading, please subscribe: + GST for 9 weeks of unlimited access* There are 9.2 million lead pipes in the U.S. They contaminate drinking water with lead, which damages brain development in children. But around the country, utilities have been ignoring the opportunity to remove lead pipe when they uncover it during work on water mains. They’ve often removed a short pipe section, reburied the connection and left the rest. Research shows this method can actually spike, rather than reduce, lead levels. The sections of pipe that remain can contaminate tap water until they’re removed. The practice is also more expensive in the long run, since crews presumably will have to return someday. Here are some takeaways from The Associated Press investigation: LEAD IS HARMFUL Lead is a health threat and the practice of leaving sections of the old pipe behind should have stopped a long time ago, according to Yanna Lambrinidou, a medical anthropologist at Virginia Tech and co-founder of the Campaign for Lead Free Water. Lead is especially dangerous to young children. It can lower IQ and deprive kids of cognitive skills. The Environmental Protection Agency says no amount is safe for kids. She said utilities have tried to dodge responsibility to reduce costs. “I can’t but think of partial replacements as immoral because they involve a witting decision by government agencies to leave residents at continued risk of exposure,” said Lambrinidou. Yet the practice has played out hundreds of thousands of times, in cities including Providence and Chicago. It continues today in Oklahoma City, Allentown, Pennsylvania, Nashville and Memphis, Tennessee, and St. Louis. PROVIDENCE HAS STRUGGLED In 2005, Providence Water changed the chemicals it adds to drinking water to lower levels of lead. Instead it caused them to jump — above EPA limits. That triggered an EPA requirement for Providence to remove some of its pipe, but the language of the regulation does not require entire lengths to be dug up. There, as in many cities, homeowners and the utility each own part of the water line. Providence generally removed only the part it said it was responsible for. By 2011, however, EPA scientists were weighing in, saying this method doesn’t actually lower levels of lead in water. Providence was still in the middle of a lead crisis with its water. Yet despite the fact that its practice didn’t work and could even make things worse, the city continued the approach when it worked on mains, only taking out entire lengths of lead pipe if the homeowner paid for it. Activists said Providence Water thus created a two-tiered system: one for people who could afford safe water and one for those who couldn’t. UTILITIES SAY IT’S COMPLICATED Removing lead pipes isn’t just the responsibility of the utility, but also individuals and government, said Steve Via, director of government relations at the American Water Works Association, a group that represents utilities. He said divided ownership of lead pipes, is “still a barrier to full lead service line replacement today.” In many communities, local rules forbid spending money to upgrade private property, blocking the work, Via said. Providence Water General Manager Ricky Caruolo said lead pipe replacement couldn’t be done without raising rates and he didn’t think it was his decision to force ratepayers to bear the cost of replacing lead pipes that are, in the end, privately owned. Most people don’t have a lead pipe, he said, so they wouldn’t benefit. That decision “needs to be made at the state or even federal level.” Caruolo also said some homes have lead fittings that will remain a risk even once the lead pipe is gone. He said officials have addressed lead head-on, improving water treatment, educating the public about lead and providing no-interest loans for removal. 2021 held some good news for Providence. The city’s results improved and are now within federal limits, much safer for young children today. CHICAGO SHOWS WHY SO MUCH REMAINS As weak as the order was in Providence, the EPA rarely goes even that far. Take the case of Chicago. About 7% of homes sampled last year exceeded federal limits. But that’s not enough to force officials there to remove the problem. State and local officials say they had limited funds and used them elsewhere. They also say local rules made removal work more difficult and expensive. Wednesdays A weekly look towards a post-pandemic future. So, three decades after the federal government imposed lead limits for drinking water, the vast majority of lead pipes are still in the ground not only in Chicago, but across the country. The Biden administration has said it wants them all removed. ___ Camille Fassett contributed reporting from Seattle.

The Met Office picked up the ants on a rain radar on Friday as people took to social media reporting sightings saying it was “flying ant day”. The forecaster said the winged insects are usually picked up on their radars at this time of the year over the space of about a week. The swarms appear on the radars and look similar to rainfall, but the Met Office can check their weather gauges to confirm if it is rain or flying ants. They creatures are less likely to fly in the rain and it is harder for the Met Office to tell if it is ants or the rainfall during wet weather, Simon Partridge, a forecaster for the Met Office, said. He added: “Every year around this time we do pick them up on the rain radar. At the moment it’s harder to tell because we’ve got so many showers and the ants look like showers. “When we do get the rain, they don’t fly as much. “It’s generally the southern parts of the UK where we tend to notice it most.

It was much drier and it was easier to spot them. “They can be seen several miles across – they look like very heavy showers. On Friday it was about a mile. “They’re an interesting phenomenon and it’s always this time of year and usually over about a week or so.” Flying ants are spotted when males and new queens leave the nest to mate, with many ant colonies doing so on the same day. According to the Royal Society of Biology, there is not always one flying ant day – on as many as 96 per cent of days between June and September, flying ants are spotted.","pubDate":"2023-07-09 14:55:51","image_url":"https://i2-prod.walesonline.co.uk/incoming/article24758088.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_JS188544426.jpg","source_id":"walesonline","category":["politics","health","top","world"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Flailing Putin sacks top general in charge of Ukraine war as forces on the backfoot","link":"https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1789142/vladimir-putin-russia-valery-gerasimov-ukraine-dxus","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Vladimir Putin is believed to be purging Russia's top military brass following a short-lived coup attempt that saw Wagner mercenaries march on Moscow.","content":"Vladimir Putin slams 'treason' from Wagner mercenary group Vladimir Putin has sacked the top general in charge of his war in Ukraine Valery Gerasimov, according to independent Russian media.

More info Trending It appears the Russian dictator may now be cleaning house following the revolt. Wagner leader Yevgeny Prigozhin has not been seen since the coup attempt despite being granted immunity to live in Belarus following a deal with Putin. In a surprise announcement, Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukashenko said Prigozhin had gone back to Russia leading to speculation over his whereabouts. Sergey Surovikin, the head of Russia ’s airborne forces, is also missing. He condemned the coup but reportedly had prior knowledge of Prigozhin’s plan. Gerasimov - who has now been sacked - has also vanished. Despite being Prigozhin’s rival, an analyst told Daily Express US that it’s possible Putin will have him take the fall for allowing Wagner forces to breach Russia ’s defences during their mutiny.

Matthew Woodward, of Barry , was fatally injured at around 4.25am on Friday in a collision involving his motorbike and a car. The driver of the car also died in the crash between Bonvilston and Cowbridge. One of Matthew's closest friends Oscar Jenkins has paid tribute to the 33-year-old who is survived by three-year-old daughter Amelia and fiancée Lauren Goodman. Oscar, whose fundraiser to support the family has already seen £3,695 in donations, told WalesOnline that Matthew was riding his motorbike home following a lorry-driving shift when the collision happened. Matthew was using the bike because he had sold his car a couple of weeks earlier following a sharp rise in the family's mortgage payments, said Oscar. Oscar, also 33, added: \"Woody was the most gentle and kind-hearted person and that's not just me saying it as a good friend. He was very softly spoken and sensitive without a bad bone in his body. We'd known each other since the start of secondary school in Shrewsbury. He met Lauren at university in Swansea and she's got quite a big family in Barry so he moved down there and they had a child. But he was always the one who made that push to get together with our group of friends from Shrewsbury whenever possible.\" Matthew Woodward is survived by fiancée Lauren and daughter Amelia Read next: Man seriously injured in Cardiff stabbing Four days before his death Matthew visited Oscar in Shrewsbury. \"It felt like an absolute blessing because it had been a while since I'd seen him,\" said Oscar. \"His fiancée had by pure chance arranged to have her eyebrows done in the area so he popped in to see us on Monday. It had been my birthday a couple of weeks before that and Woody hadn't been able to make it so he ordered a curry takeaway, brought four or five beers, and said: 'This is for missing your birthday.' We sat down and it was lovely. \"He was talking about the cost of living and how he was thinking of moving away from being a lorry driver and becoming a train driver. A week or two earlier he'd sold his BMW because the mortgage rates had gone up so much. Looking back it's so incredible that we had that opportunity to see him a final time.\" Matthew Woodward with fiancée Lauren Some of Oscar's favourite moments with Matthew came in charity soapbox races. Matthew, a former employee of the Rednal Karting track, loved motoring. He helped Oscar, whose aunt died of brain cancer, design a pink go-kart out of plumbing insulation to look like a brain and used it to fundraise for cancer research in a series of races including Penarth Downhill Derby. \"It was the most ridiculous-looking go-kart but Woody was such an incredible driver that he managed to steer this thing and beat all these local engineering firms. They couldn't believe it. The last two years he won the Penarth race both times. He was such a gentle soul but when he got on a racetrack it was like he had an ultra-competitive alter ego. Racing was his absolute love. We raised about £2,500 in total over five races across the country.\" The couple were engaged Oscar added that caring for family and friends was extremely important to Matthew. He gave the example of a kind gesture towards a friend who needed a car but was struggling for cash. \"Woody transferred a number of thousands of pounds to make sure he got the car he wanted and said: 'Pay me back when you can.' He was very generous with his friends.\" The GoFundMe campaign will go towards supporting Matthew's family and helping with funeral costs. You can donate here .

It comes after claims the man paid a teenager £35,000 for explicit images. This money funded the teen's drug habit, their mother has alleged. The presenter - who has not been named publicly - has been taken off air. The broadcaster released a statement on the scandal this afternoon (July 9), The Sun reports. A spokesperson for the BBC said: \"The BBC takes any allegations seriously and we have robust internal processes in place to proactively deal with such allegations.

It is important that these matters are handled fairly and with care.\" They continued: \"We have been clear that if - at any point - new information comes to light or is provided to us, this will be acted upon appropriately and actively followed up. The BBC first became aware of a complaint in May. \"New allegations were put to us on Thursday of a different nature and in addition to our own enquiries we have also been in touch with external authorities, in line with our protocols. We can also confirm a male member of staff has been suspended. \"We expect to be in a position to provide a further update in the coming days as the process continues. The BBC Board will continue to be kept up to date.\" The mother of the child who claims the BBC star paid her child for sexual pictures said she was stunned to see a phone image of the presenter in his boxer shorts. \"I loved watching him on TV,\" she told The Sun. The mum added: \"So I was shocked to see a picture of him sitting on a sofa in his house in his underwear. I immediately recognised him.\" The news comes after Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer sat down with the BBC boss Tim Davie. She said: \"I have spoken to BBC Director General Tim Davie about the deeply concerning allegations involving one of its presenters. \"He has assured me the BBC are investigating swiftly and sensitively. Given the nature of the allegations it is important that the BBC is now given the space to conduct its investigation, establish the facts and take appropriate action.

Biden's first stop will be in London, where he will meet British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak at 10 Downing Street on Monday and then travel to Windsor Castle for a visit with King Charles. The talks with the king, expected to include climate initiatives, will give Biden a greater sense of the man who succeeded his mother, Queen Elizabeth, who died last September. Biden had tea with the queen at Windsor in June 2021 and they discussed many of the same issues that remain a top priority today, like Russia and China. Biden will travel on to Vilnius, Lithuania, on Monday night and hold talks with NATO leaders there on Tuesday and Wednesday. Biden and the allies aim to show support for Ukraine and give Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy a sense of what he will have to do to gain NATO membership at some point in the future. In a CNN interview previewing his trip, Biden urged caution for now on Ukraine's drive to join NATO, saying the alliance could get drawn into the war with Russia due to NATO's mutual defense pact. \"I don't think there is unanimity in NATO about whether or not to bring Ukraine into the NATO family now, at this moment, in the middle of a war,\" Biden said. A centerpiece of Biden's visit to Lithuania will be a speech that he will deliver at Vilnius University on Wednesday night. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters the speech will cover Biden's vision of \"a strong, confident America flanked by strong, confident allies and partners taking on the significant challenges of our time, from Russia's aggression in Ukraine to the climate crisis.\" One of Biden's objectives on the trip is to show Americans back home the importance of continuing support for Ukraine as he faces re-election. Some of his Republican rivals in the race for the November 2024 presidential elections have voiced doubts about his strategy. Solid majorities of Americans support providing weaponry to Ukraine to defend itself against Russia and believe that such aid demonstrates to China and other US rivals a will to protect US interests and allies, according to a Reuters/Ipsos survey late last month.
